Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. Though immune checkpoint inhibition has proven effective for a number of other tumors, it offers benefits in only a small group of CRC. In general, heterogenous cell groups in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are considered as the major barrier for unveiling the causes of low immune response. Therefore, deconvolution of cellular components in highly heterogeneous microenvironments is crucial for understanding those mechanisms. Single cell sequencing technology revolutionized TME research enabling profiling cells in high resolution. Methods: We have analyzed scRNA-seq data from 23 CRC patients with pre-treatment primary tumors using Seurat V3 pipeline. To investigate intercellular ligand-receptor interactions, we used CellPhoneDB and CellChat methods. The results of two independent analyses showed 4 CRC samples with no SPP1-CD44 interaction. It is known, that OPN which is the protein encoded by SPP1 gene, binds to CD44 and can cause cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, analysis of the cellular composition of all 23 samples did not reveal differences in SPP1+ macrophages’ content for those 4 “no SPP1-CD44” samples. To investigate the mechanisms that could cause differences in SPP1-CD44 expression across the samples, we analyzed developmental trajectories of single cells using Slingshot trajectory inference method. Results: Ligand-receptor interactions analysis revealed 4 CRC samples that lacked SPP1-CD44 interaction that is known to be responsible for tumor progression in CRC. But the proportion of SPP1+ cells was not significantly different in those 4 samples compared to other samples. Trajectory inference analysis showed that the cells from “no SPP1-CD44” samples had high expression of anti-inflammatory macrophage markers in the end of the trajectory. While cells from “high SPP1-CD44” samples had high expression of pro-inflammatory macrophage markers at the same point. Conclusions: Based on our data-driven study, we suggest that SPP1+ macrophages’ heterogeneity may affect SPP1-CD44 interaction. Thus, targeting SPP1+ macrophages that have anti-inflammatory phenotype can potentially interrupt SPP1-CD44 interaction and therefore reduce tumor progression and immune suppression.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12943-022-01553-5},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are liquid biopsies that represent micrometastatic disease and may offer unique insights into future recurrences in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Due to CTC rarity and limited stability, no stable CTC-derived xenograft (CDX) models have ever been generated from non-metastatic NSCLC patients directly. Alternative strategies are needed to molecularly characterize CTCs and means of potential future metastases in this potentially curable patient group.
METHODS: Surgically resected NSCLC primary tumor tissues from non-metastatic patients were implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice to establish primary tumor patient-derived xenograft (ptPDX) models. CTCs were isolated as liquid biopsies from the blood of ptPDX mice and re-implanted subcutaneously into naïve immunodeficient mice to generate liquid biopsy CTC-derived xenograft (CDX) tumor models. Single cell RNA sequencing was performed and validated in an external dataset of non-xenografted human NSCLC primary tumor and metastases tissues. Drug response testing in CDX models was performed with standard of care chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel). Blockade of MYC, which has a known role in drug resistance, was performed with a MYC/MAX dimerization inhibitor (10058-F4).
RESULTS: Out of ten ptPDX, two (20\%) stable liquid biopsy CDX mouse models were generated. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed an additional regenerative alveolar epithelial type II (AT2)-like cell population in CDX tumors that was also identified in non-xenografted NSCLC patients' metastases tissues. Drug testing using these CDX models revealed different treatment responses to carboplatin/paclitaxel. MYC target genes and c-MYC protein were upregulated in the chemoresistant CDX model, while MYC/MAX dimerization blocking could overcome chemoresistance to carboplatin/paclitaxel.
CONCLUSIONS: To overcome the lack of liquid biopsy CDX models from non-metastatic NSCLC patients, CDX models can be generated with CTCs from ptPDX models that were originally established from patients' primary tumors. Single cell analyses can identify distinct drug responses and cell heterogeneities in CDX tumors that can be validated in NSCLC metastases tissues. CDX models deserve further development and study to discover personalized strategies against micrometastases in non-metastatic NSCLC patients.},

	abstract = {Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration is associated with survival, recurrence, and therapeutic response in colorectal cancer (CRC). Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, which requires CTLs for response, does not work for most CRC patients. Therefore, it is critical to improve our understanding of immune resistance in this disease. We utilized 2391 CRC patients and 7 omics datasets, integrating clinical and genomic data to determine how DNA methylation may impact survival and CTL function in CRC. Using comprehensive molecular subtype (CMS) 1 patients as reference, we found TBX21 to be the only gene with altered expression and methylation that was associated with CTL infiltration. We found that CMS1 patients with high TBX21 expression and low methylation had a significant survival advantage. To confirm the role of Tbx21 in CTL function, we utilized scRNAseq data, demonstrating the association of TBX21 with markers of enhanced CTL function. Further analysis using pathway enrichment found that the genes TBX21, MX1, and SP140 had altered expression and methylation, suggesting that the TP53/P53 pathway may modify TBX21 methylation to upregulate TBX21 expression. Together, this suggests that targeting epigenetic modification more specifically for therapy and patient stratification may provide improved outcomes in CRC.},

	abstract = {Many high-quality biological pathways are presented in figures and text in biomedical literature. They are great resources for studies of biological mechanisms and precision medicine practices. These pathways need to be carefully curated, reconciled, and transformed into a computable form. Current manual curation approaches are inadequate in keeping up with the pace of the literature growth. New bio-curation approaches are needed to streamline the identification of gene interactions from pathway figures and text. This paper proposes a pathway curation approach for identifying genes and their interactions using both figures and text of biomedical articles. Our method integrates deep learning-based object detection models with a Google optical character recognition service to extract genes and their interactions from pathway figures. Our pipeline was evaluated on the figures from PubMed publications with manual annotations. The results demonstrated that our model could effectively retrieve genes and their interactions in pathway figures. The proposed pipeline may accelerate various applications of the latest biomedical discoveries. We also developed a web server at http://pathwaydeep.top to provide the gene interaction curation on uploaded pathway figures and corresponding articles.},

	doi = {10.4103/jpi.jpi_30_19},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Free-text sections of pathology reports contain the most important information from a diagnostic standpoint. However, this information is largely underutilized for computer-based analytics. The vast majority of NLP-based methods lack a capacity to accurately extract complex diagnostic entities and relationships among them as well as to provide an adequate knowledge representation for downstream data-mining applications.
METHODS: In this paper, we introduce a novel informatics pipeline that extends open information extraction (openIE) techniques with artificial intelligence (AI) based modeling to extract and transform complex diagnostic entities and relationships among them into Knowledge Graphs (KGs) of relational triples (RTs).
RESULTS: Evaluation studies have demonstrated that the pipeline's output significantly differs from a random process. The semantic similarity with original reports is high (Mean Weighted Overlap of 0.83). The precision and recall of extracted RTs based on experts' assessment were 0.925 and 0.841 respectively (P {\textless}0.0001). Inter-rater agreement was significant at 93.6\% and inter-rated reliability was 81.8\%.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated important properties of the pipeline such as high accuracy, minimality and adequate knowledge representation. Therefore, we conclude that the pipeline can be used in various downstream data-mining applications to assist diagnostic medicine.},
