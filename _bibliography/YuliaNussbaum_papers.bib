	abstract = {The microsatellite instable (MSI) subset of colorectal cancer (CRC)
exhibits an active Th1/CTL immune microenvironment probably due to recognition
of a high number of tumor neoantigens. However, the high expression of
checkpoint molecules PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and IDO in MSI CRC
distinguishes MSI from microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC and creates an
immunosuppressive microenvironment that may help MSI tumors evade immune
destruction by the infiltrating immune cells. Though CRC does not have a good
response rate to PD-1 pathway immunotherapy, these results suggest that the MSI
subset of CRC is a particularly good candidate for checkpoint immunotherapy.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cause of cancer death in the United States. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society provides an update of CRC occurrence based on incidence data (available through 2016) from population-based cancer registries and mortality data (through 2017) from the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2020, approximately 147,950 individuals will be diagnosed with CRC and 53,200 will die from the disease, including 17,930 cases and 3,640 deaths in individuals aged younger than 50 years. The incidence rate during 2012 through 2016 ranged from 30 (per 100,000 persons) in Asian/Pacific Islanders to 45.7 in blacks and 89 in Alaska Natives. Rapid declines in incidence among screening-aged individuals during the 2000s continued during 2011 through 2016 in those aged 65 years and older (by 3.3\% annually) but reversed in those aged 50 to 64 years, among whom rates increased by 1\% annually. Among individuals aged younger than 50 years, the incidence rate increased by approximately 2\% annually for tumors in the proximal and distal colon, as well as the rectum, driven by trends in non-Hispanic whites. CRC death rates during 2008 through 2017 declined by 3\% annually in individuals aged 65 years and older and by 0.6\% annually in individuals aged 50 to 64 years while increasing by 1.3\% annually in those aged younger than 50 years. Mortality declines among individuals aged 50 years and older were steepest among blacks, who also had the only decreasing trend among those aged younger than 50 years, and excluded American Indians/Alaska Natives, among whom rates remained stable. Progress against CRC can be accelerated by increasing access to guideline-recommended screening and high-quality treatment, particularly among Alaska Natives, and elucidating causes for rising incidence in young and middle-aged adults.},

	abstract = {This article provides a status report on the global burden of cancer worldwide using the GLOBOCAN 2018 estimates of cancer incidence and mortality produced by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, with a focus on geographic variability across 20 world regions. There will be an estimated 18.1 million new cancer cases (17.0 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and 9.6 million cancer deaths (9.5 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) in 2018. In both sexes combined, lung cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer (11.6\% of the total cases) and the leading cause of cancer death (18.4\% of the total cancer deaths), closely followed by female breast cancer (11.6\%), prostate cancer (7.1\%), and colorectal cancer (6.1\%) for incidence and colorectal cancer (9.2\%), stomach cancer (8.2\%), and liver cancer (8.2\%) for mortality. Lung cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among males, followed by prostate and colorectal cancer (for incidence) and liver and stomach cancer (for mortality). Among females, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, followed by colorectal and lung cancer (for incidence), and vice versa (for mortality); cervical cancer ranks fourth for both incidence and mortality. The most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death, however, substantially vary across countries and within each country depending on the degree of economic development and associated social and life style factors. It is noteworthy that high-quality cancer registry data, the basis for planning and implementing evidence-based cancer control programs, are not available in most low- and middle-income countries. The Global Initiative for Cancer Registry Development is an international partnership that supports better estimation, as well as the collection and use of local data, to prioritize and evaluate national cancer control efforts.

We characterized the tumor-infiltrating immune cells in large cohorts of human colorectal cancers by gene expression profiling and in situ immunohistochemical staining. Collectively, the immunological data (the type, density, and location of immune cells within the tumor samples) were found to be a better predictor of patient survival than the histopathological methods currently used to stage colorectal cancer. The results were validated in two additional patient populations. These data support the hypothesis that the adaptive immune response influences the behavior of human tumors. In situ analysis of tumor-infiltrating immune cells may therefore be a valuable prognostic tool in the treatment of colorectal cancer and possibly other malignancies.
The progress of colorectal cancer in patients can be predicted from the characteristics of the immune cells found in their tumors.

	abstract = {Tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) play essential roles in cancer development and progression. However, the association of TIICs with prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients remains elusive. Infiltration of TIICs was assessed using ssGSEA and CIBERSORT tools. The association of TIICs with prognosis was analyzed in 1,802 CRC data downloaded from the GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and TCGA (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) databases. Three populations of TIICs, including CD66b+ tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs), FoxP3+ Tregs, and CD163+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were selected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) validation analysis in 1,008 CRC biopsies, and their influence on clinical features and prognosis of CRC patients was analyzed. Prognostic models were constructed based on the training cohort (359 patients). The models were further tested and verified in testing (249 patients) and validation cohorts (400 patients). Based on ssGSEA and CIBERSORT analysis, the correlation between TIICs and CRC prognosis was inconsistent in different datasets. Moreover, the results with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) data in the same dataset also differed. The high abundance of TIICs found by ssGSEA or CIBERSORT tools can be used for prognostic evaluation effectively. IHC results showed that TANs, Tregs, TAMs were significantly correlated with prognosis in CRC patients and were independent prognostic factors (PDFS ≤ 0.001; POS ≤ 0.023). The prognostic predictive models were constructed based on the numbers of TANs, Tregs, TAMs (C-indexDFS\&OS = 0.86; AICDFS = 448.43; AICOS = 184.30) and they were more reliable than traditional indicators for evaluating prognosis in CRC patients. Besides, TIICs may affect the response to chemotherapy. In conclusion, TIICs were correlated with clinical features and prognosis in patients with CRC and thus can be used as markers.},

In addition to detailing major challenges and statistical limitations encountered during the effort of integrating the acquired clinical data, we present a summary that includes endpoint usage recommendations for each cancer type.

After demonstrating improvement over existing methods for integrating scRNA-seq data, we anchor scRNA-seq experiments with scATAC-seq to explore chromatin differences in closely related interneuron subsets and project protein expression measurements onto a bone marrow atlas to characterize lymphocyte populations.

Previous work has indicated that quantification of inflammatory cell reaction is of prognostic value in colorectal cancer. We evaluated the prognostic significance of inflammatory cell reaction patterns in colorectal cancer and developed a grading method which could be used in the routine assessment of tumours.
Methods
The intensity of overall inflammatory cell reaction, numbers of neutrophilic and eosinophilic granulocytes, lymphoid cells and macrophages in both the central region and the invasive margin were estimated in 386 colorectal cancer patients. Prognostic significance was analysed by uni- and multivariate analysis.
Results
Our method for classification of inflammatory reaction was reliable. High-grade inflammation at the invasive margin in Dukes’ stage A and B cancers (pT1-2N0 and pT3N0, respectively) was associated with better 5-year-survival (87.6\%) than low-grade inflammation (47.0\%).
Conclusions
Inflammatory cell response at the invasive border is a relevant prognostic indicator and could be easily incorporated into the routine evaluation of histopathological specimens.},

Two hundred and forty-six patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database of CRC resections in a single surgical unit. Assessment of KM grade and TSP was performed using full H\&E sections. CD3+ and CD8+ T-cell density was assessed on full sections and the Immunoscore calculated. KM grade and Immunoscore were strongly associated (p {\textless} 0.001). KM grade stratified cancer-specific survival (CSS) from 88\% to 66\% (p = 0.002) and Immunoscore from 93\% to 61\% (p {\textless} 0.001). Immunoscore further stratified survival of patients independent of KM grade from 94\% (high KM, Im4) to 60\% (low KM, Im0/1). Furthermore, TSP stratified survival of patients with a weak inflammatory cell infiltrate (low KM: from 75\% to 47\%; Im0/1: from 71\% to 38\%, both p {\textless} 0.001) but not those with a strong inflammatory infiltrate. On multivariate analysis, only Immunoscore (HR 0.44, p {\textless} 0.001) and TSP (HR 2.04, p {\textless} 0.001) were independently associated with CSS. These results suggest that the prognostic value of an immunohistochemistry-based assessment of the inflammatory cell infiltrate is superior to H\&E-based assessment in patients undergoing resection of stage I-III CRC. Furthermore, assessment of the tumor-associated stroma, using TSP, further improves prediction of outcome.},

	abstract = {Background
Cancer-associated inflammation is increasingly recognised to be an important determinant of oncological outcome. In colorectal cancer, the presence of peri-tumoural inflammatory/lymphocytic infiltrates predicts improved survival. To date, these infiltrates, assessed visually on haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained sections, have failed to enter routine clinical practice, partly due to their subjective assessment and considerable inter-observer variation. The present study aims to develop an automated scoring method to enable consistent and reproducible assessment of tumour inflammatory infiltrates in colorectal cancer.
Methods
154 colorectal cancer patients who underwent curative resection were included in the study. The local inflammatory infiltrate was assessed using the method described by Klintrup–Makinen. H\&E tumour sections were uploaded to an image analysis programme (Slidepath, Leica Biosystems). An image analysis algorithm was developed to count the inflammatory cells at the invasive margin. The manual and automated assessments of the tumour inflammatory infiltrates were then compared.
Results
The automated inflammatory cell counts assessed using the freehand annotation method (p{\textless}0.001) and the rectangular box method (p{\textless}0.001) were significantly associated with both K–M score (p{\textless}0.001) and K–M grade (p{\textless}0.001). The inflammatory cell counts were divided using quartiles to group tumours with similar inflammatory cell densities. There was good agreement between the manual and automated scoring methods (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.82). Similar to the visual K–M scoring system, the automated K–M classification of the inflammatory cell counts, using quartiles, was significantly associated with venous invasion (p{\textless}0.05) and modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) (p⩽0.05). On univariate survival analysis, both automated K–M category (p{\textless}0.05) and automated K–M grade (p{\textless}0.005) were associated with cancer-specific survival.
Conclusion
The results of the present study demonstrate that automated assessment effectively recapitulates the clinical value of visual assessment of the local inflammatory cell infiltrate at the invasive margin of colorectal tumours. In addition, it is possible to obtain an objective assessment of tumour inflammatory infiltrates using routinely stained H\&E sections. An automated, computer-based scoring method is therefore a workable and cost-effective approach to clinical assessment of local immune cell infiltrates in colorectal cancer.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Many patients who present with early-stage colorectal cancer (International Union Against Cancer TNM stages I and II) are nevertheless at high risk of relapse. We hypothesized that intratumoral immune reaction could influence their prognosis.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The intratumoral immune reaction was investigated in 29 tumors by large-scale real-time polymerase chain reaction. Cytotoxic (CD8) and memory (CD45RO) T cells were quantified by immunohistochemical analyses of tissue microarrays from the center (CT) and the invasive margin (IM) of the 602 tumors from two independent cohorts. The results were correlated with tumor recurrence and patient survival.
RESULTS: Patients with a strong infiltration of CD45RO(+) cells in the tumor exhibited an increased expression of T-helper 1 and cytotoxicity-related genes. Densities of CD45RO(+) and CD8(+) cells in tumor regions (CT/IM) classified the patients into four distinct prognostic groups based on the presence of high density of each marker in each tumor region. The four groups were associated with dramatic differences in disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival (all P {\textless} .0001). Five years after diagnosis, only 4.8\% (95\% CI, 0.6\% to 8.8\%) of patients with high densities of CD8(+) plus CD45RO(+) cells had tumor recurrence, and 86.2\% (CI, 79.4\% to 93.6\%) survived. In contrast, the tumor recurred in 75\% (95\% CI, 17\% to 92.5\%) of patients with low densities of these cells, and only 27.5\% (95\% CI, 10.5\% to 72\%) survived (all P {\textless} .0001). Multivariate analyses showed that the immune criteria had independent effects on the rates of complete remission and survival.
CONCLUSION: The combined analysis of CD8(+) plus CD45RO(+) cells in specific tumor regions could provide a useful criterion for the prediction of tumor recurrence and survival in patients with early-stage colorectal cancer.},

	abstract = {Background
The estimation of risk of recurrence for patients with colon carcinoma must be improved. A robust immune score quantification is needed to introduce immune parameters into cancer classification. The aim of the study was to assess the prognostic value of total tumour-infiltrating T-cell counts and cytotoxic tumour-infiltrating T-cells counts with the consensus Immunoscore assay in patients with stage I–III colon cancer.
Methods
An international consortium of 14 centres in 13 countries, led by the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer, assessed the Immunoscore assay in patients with TNM stage I–III colon cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to a training set, an internal validation set, or an external validation set. Paraffin sections of the colon tumour and invasive margin from each patient were processed by immunohistochemistry, and the densities of CD3+ and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the tumour and in the invasive margin were quantified by digital pathology. An Immunoscore for each patient was derived from the mean of four density percentiles. The primary endpoint was to evaluate the prognostic value of the Immunoscore for time to recurrence, defined as time from surgery to disease recurrence. Stratified multivariable Cox models were used to assess the associations between Immunoscore and outcomes, adjusting for potential confounders. Harrell's C-statistics was used to assess model performance.
Findings
Tissue samples from 3539 patients were processed, and samples from 2681 patients were included in the analyses after quality controls (700 patients in the training set, 636 patients in the internal validation set, and 1345 patients in the external validation set). The Immunoscore assay showed a high level of reproducibility between observers and centres (r=0·97 for colon tumour; r=0·97 for invasive margin; p{\textless}0·0001). In the training set, patients with a high Immunoscore had the lowest risk of recurrence at 5 years (14 [8\%] patients with a high Immunoscore vs 65 (19\%) patients with an intermediate Immunoscore vs 51 (32\%) patients with a low Immunoscore; hazard ratio [HR] for high vs low Immunoscore 0·20, 95\% CI 0·10–0·38; p{\textless}0·0001). The findings were confirmed in the two validation sets (n=1981). In the stratified Cox multivariable analysis, the Immunoscore association with time to recurrence was independent of patient age, sex, T stage, N stage, microsatellite instability, and existing prognostic factors (p{\textless}0·0001). Of 1434 patients with stage II cancer, the difference in risk of recurrence at 5 years was significant (HR for high vs low Immunoscore 0·33, 95\% CI 0·21–0·52; p{\textless}0·0001), including in Cox multivariable analysis (p{\textless}0·0001). Immunoscore had the highest relative contribution to the risk of all clinical parameters, including the American Joint Committee on Cancer and Union for International Cancer Control TNM classification system.
Interpretation
The Immunoscore provides a reliable estimate of the risk of recurrence in patients with colon cancer. These results support the implementation of the consensus Immunoscore as a new component of a TNM-Immune classification of cancer.

	abstract = {Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the numbers of new cancer cases and deaths that will occur in the United States and compiles the most recent data on population-based cancer occurrence. Incidence data (through 2016) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2017) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2020, 1,806,590 new cancer cases and 606,520 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. The cancer death rate rose until 1991, then fell continuously through 2017, resulting in an overall decline of 29\% that translates into an estimated 2.9 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. This progress is driven by long-term declines in death rates for the 4 leading cancers (lung, colorectal, breast, prostate); however, over the past decade (2008-2017), reductions slowed for female breast and colorectal cancers, and halted for prostate cancer. In contrast, declines accelerated for lung cancer, from 3\% annually during 2008 through 2013 to 5\% during 2013 through 2017 in men and from 2\% to almost 4\% in women, spurring the largest ever single-year drop in overall cancer mortality of 2.2\% from 2016 to 2017. Yet lung cancer still caused more deaths in 2017 than breast, prostate, colorectal, and brain cancers combined. Recent mortality declines were also dramatic for melanoma of the skin in the wake of US Food and Drug Administration approval of new therapies for metastatic disease, escalating to 7\% annually during 2013 through 2017 from 1\% during 2006 through 2010 in men and women aged 50 to 64 years and from 2\% to 3\% in those aged 20 to 49 years; annual declines of 5\% to 6\% in individuals aged 65 years and older are particularly striking because rates in this age group were increasing prior to 2013. It is also notable that long-term rapid increases in liver cancer mortality have attenuated in women and stabilized in men. In summary, slowing momentum for some cancers amenable to early detection is juxtaposed with notable gains for other common cancers.},

Since targeted and immunotherapies have emerged as novel approaches for more tailored treatments, repeated assessments of the tumor biology have become pivotal to drive clinical decisions. Currently, tumor tissue biopsy is the gold standard to investigate potentially actionable biomarkers, but this procedure is invasive and may prove inadequate to represent the whole malignancy. In this regard, liquid biopsy represents a minimally invasive and more comprehensive option for early detection and investigation of this tumor. Today, cell-free DNA is the only approved circulating marker to select patients for a targeted therapy. Conversely, the other tumor-derived markers (i.e., circulating tumor cells, miRNAs, exosomes, and tumor educated platelets) are still at a pre-clinical phase, although they show promising results for their application in screening programs or as prognostic/predictive biomarkers. The main challenges for their clinical translation are the lack of reliable cutoffs and, especially for miRNAs, the great variability among the studies. Moreover, no established tool has been approved for circulating tumor cells and exosome isolation. Finally, large prospective clinical trials are mandatory to provide evidence of their clinical utility.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases., Results: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy., Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code.

Clinical trials have shown that appropriate enhancement of a tumor immune response can lead to long-lasting clinical responses and patient benefit. Understanding the contribution of the immune contexture, in addition to the molecular subtype across different tumor indications, is a significant knowledge gap with limited sagacity to drive rational immunotherapy combinations. To better inform clinical studies, we must first strive to understand the multifaceted elements of the tumor-immune interaction, the spatiotemporal interplay of numerous different immune cell types, in conjunction with an understanding of the oncogenic drivers and mutations that may lead to presentation of neoepitopes and could drive changes within the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we discuss the Immunoscore and its probable universal characteristic. The overlay of immune quantification with the molecular segments of disease and how this may benefit identification of patients at high risk of tumor recurrence will be discussed. The Immunoscore may translate to provide a tumor agnostic method to define immune fitness of a given tumor and predict and stratify patients who will benefit from certain therapies (in particular immune therapies) and, ultimately, help save the lives of patients with cancer.},

However, a direct role of the VEGF-A/VEGFR pathway inhibition in this phenomenon is a matter of debate and molecular mechanisms leading to Treg modulation in this setting have not been explored to date. Treg proportion, number, and proliferation were analyzed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) treated with bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting specifically VEGF-A, and in colon cancer-bearing mice (CT26) treated with drugs targeting the VEGF/VEGFR axis. The direct impact of VEGF-A on Treg induction was assessed together with specific blockade of different isoforms of VEGFRs that may be involved. In CT26-bearing mice, anti-VEGF antibody and sunitinib treatments reduced Treg but masitinib, a TKI not targeting VEGFR, did not. Targeting VEGF-A/VEGFR axis seems sufficient to affect Treg percentages, without any changes in their function. Similarly, bevacizumab inhibited Treg accumulation in peripheral blood of patients with mCRCs. In vitro, Treg expressing VEGFR from tumor-bearing mice directly proliferated in response to VEGF-A. Anti-VEGF-A treatment decreased Treg proliferation in mice as well as in patients with mCRCs. VEGFR-2- but not VEGFR-1-specific blockade led to the same results. We identified a novel mechanism of tumor escape by which VEGF-A directly triggers Treg proliferation. This proliferation is inhibited by VEGF-A/VEGFR-2 blockade. Anti-VEGF-A therapies also have immunologic effects that may be used with a therapeutic goal in the future.},

Flow cytometry revealed that the majority of intratumoral CD4+Foxp3+ T cells (Tregs) were Helios+ and expressed higher levels of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and CD39 than Tregs from colon and blood. Moreover, ∼30\% of intratumoral CD4+Foxp3− T cells expressed markers associated with regulatory functions, including latency-associated peptide (LAP), lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3), and CD25. This unique population of cells produced interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), and was ∼50-fold more suppressive than Foxp3+ Tregs.

Isotope labelled antibodies recognize surface markers to delineate cell types and intracellular signaling molecules to provide a measure of the network state—and thereby demarcating multiple cell state functions such as apoptosis, DNA damage and cell cycle. By measuring all these parameters simultaneously, the signaling state of an individual cell can be measured at its network state.

The mechanisms of pathogen clearance, inflammation and regulation by T cells in the healthy bowel are also important in controlling tumor growth. The majority of studies analyzing T cells and their relationship to colorectal tumor growth have focused on individual T cell markers or gene clusters and thus the complexity of the T cell response contributing to the growth of the tumor is not clear. We have studied the T cells in colorectal cancer patients and have defined a unique T cell signature for colorectal tumor tissue. Using a novel analytical flow cytometric approach in concert with confocal microscopy, we have shown that the tumor has a lower frequency of effector T cells (CD69+), but a higher frequency of both regulatory (CD25hi Foxp3+) and inflammatory T cells (IL-17+) compared with associated nontransformed bowel tissue. We have also identified minor populations of T cells expressing conventional markers of both inflammatory and regulatory T cells (CD4+IL-17+Foxp3+) in the tumor tissue. These cells may represent intermediate populations or they may dictate an inflammatory versus regulatory function in surrounding T cells. Together, these data describe an immune microenvironment in colorectal cancer unique to the tumor tissue and distinct from the surrounding healthy bowel tissue, and this distinct environment is reflected by a gradient of T cells expressing markers of multiple T cell populations. These findings may be used to improve diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer patients.},

However, immunotherapies against CRC have only shown limited success, which may be due to lack of understanding about the effect of the local tumor microenvironment (TME) on T cell function. The goal of this study was to determine whether T cells in tumor tissue were functionally impaired compared to T cells in non-tumor bowel (NTB) tissue from the same patients. We showed that T cell populations are affected differently by the TME. In the tumor, T cells produced more IL-17 and less IL-2 per cell than their counterparts from NTB tissue. T cells from tumor tissue also had impaired proliferative ability compared to T cells in NTB tissue. This impairment was not related to the frequency of IL-2 producing T cells or regulatory T cells, but T cells from the TME had a higher co-expression of inhibitory receptors than T cells from NTB. Overall, our data indicate that T cells in tumor tissue are functionally altered by the CRC TME, which is likely due to cell intrinsic factors. The TME is therefore an important consideration in predicting the effect of immune modulatory therapies.},

Here, we evaluated 190 patients with CRC for the presence of functionally active tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), the tumor specificity of these TILs, and the correlation between patient TILs and long-term survival. Using intracytoplasmic cytokine staining in conjunction with HLA multimers loaded with tumor peptide and antigen-specific cytokine secretion assays, we determined that TNF-α expression delineates a population of tumor antigen-specific (TA-specific) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) present within tumors from patients with CRC. Upregulation of TNF-α expression in TILs strongly correlated with an increase in the total amount of intratumoral TNF-α, which is indicative of tumor-specific CTL activity. Moreover, a retrospective multivariate analysis of 102 patients with CRC, which had multiple immune parameters evaluated, revealed that increased TNF-α concentration was an independent prognostic factor. Together, these results indicate that the prognostic impact of T cell infiltrates for CRC maybe largely based on subpopulations of active TA-specific T cells within the tumor, suggesting causal implication for these cells in patient survival. Additionally, these results support the use of intratumoral TNF-α, which is indicative of T cell function, as a prognostic parameter for CRC.},

Research over past decades have profoundly enhanced our understanding of immunotherapy, a major clinical accomplishment, and its potential role towards treating CC. However, studies investigating the expression of these immune checkpoints, such as epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), programmed death-1 (PD-1), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is lacking. Here, high-dimensional mass cytometry (CyTOF) is used to investigate immune alterations and promising immunotherapeutic targets expression by PBMCs of CC patients. Results reveal that expression of EpCAM and PD-L1 on CD4+ T cells significantly increased in patients with CC, compared with age- and sex- matching healthy controls and patients with colonic polyps. These differences are also validated in an independent patient cohort using flow cytometry. Further analysis revealed that EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells are PD-L1+ CCR5+ CCR6+. Immunofluorescence staining results demonstrate that the increase of EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells is also observed in tumor tissues, rather than para-cancerous tissues. To ascertain the functional disorders of the identified cell subset, phosphorylated signaling protein levels are assessed using imaging mass cytometry. Increases in pp38 MAPK and pMAPKAPK2 are observable, indicating abnormal activation of pp38 MAPK-pMAPKAPK2 signaling pathway. Results in this study indicate that EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells may play a role in CC development. Detailed knowledge on the functionality of EpCAM+ CD4+ T cells is of high translational relevance.},

This study evaluated the association and interaction between lymphocytic infiltration and tumor budding, coregistered on a single slide, in order to determine a more precise prognostic algorithm for patients with stage II colorectal cancer. Multiplexed immunofluorescence and automated image analysis were used for the quantification of CD3+CD8+ T cells, and tumor buds (TBs), across whole slide images of three independent cohorts (training cohort: n = 114, validation cohort 1: n = 56, validation cohort 2: n = 62). Machine learning algorithms were used for feature selection and prognostic risk model development. High numbers of TBs [HR = 5.899; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.875-18.55], low CD3+ T-cell density (HR = 9.964; 95\% CI, 3.156-31.46), and low mean number of CD3+CD8+ T cells within 50 μm of TBs (HR = 8.907; 95\% CI, 2.834-28.0) were associated with reduced disease-specific survival. A prognostic signature, derived from integrating TBs, lymphocyte infiltration, and their spatial relationship, reported a more significant cohort stratification (HR = 18.75; 95\% CI, 6.46-54.43), than TBs, Immunoscore, or pT stage. This was confirmed in two independent validation cohorts (HR = 12.27; 95\% CI, 3.524-42.73; HR = 15.61; 95\% CI, 4.692-51.91). The investigation of the spatial relationship between lymphocytes and TBs within the tumor microenvironment improves accuracy of prognosis of patients with stage II colorectal cancer through an automated image analysis and machine learning workflow.},

	abstract = {Purpose
tumor-infiltrating immune cells are highly relevant to the progression and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study is to explore the immune cells and immune-related gene expression in tumor microenvironment of CRC.
Methods
CIBERSORT, a deconvolution algorithm, was used to analyze the infiltration of 22 immune cell types in the tumor microenvironment and immune-related gene expression in 404 CRC and 40 adjacent non-tumorous tissues.
Results
a wide heterogeneity of immune cells among different paired tissues and in tumor stages was uncovered. M0 macrophages, M1 macrophages and CD4 memory activated T cells were infiltrated significantly more in CRC compared with normal tissues in both TCGA and GEO cohorts. CRC with T1–2 tumor stage showed increased CD4 memory activated T cells compared with T3–4 tumors. M0 macrophages were the highest in stage N1 tumors. Significant immune-related genes were identified to build prognostic models by Cox regression analysis. The concordance index of the prognostic model for TNM stage I–II was 0.69, and 0.71 for stage III–IV. The AUC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survivals were 0.674, 0.773, 0.812 for TNM stage I–II, respectively, and 0.764, 0.782, 0.803 for stage III–IV, respectively.
Conclusion
these results could assist clinicians in selecting targets for immunotherapies and individualize treatment strategies for patients with CRC.},

	abstract = {Background: Layilin (LAYN) is a critical gene that regulates T cell function. However, the correlations of LAYN to prognosis and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in different cancers remain unclear. Methods: LAYN expression was analyzed via the Oncomine database and Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER) site. We evaluated the influence of LAYN on clinical prognosis using Kaplan-Meier plotter, the PrognoScan database and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). The correlations between LAYN and cancer immune infiltrates was investigated via TIMER. In addition, correlations between LAYN expression and gene marker sets of immune infiltrates were analyzed by TIMER and GEPIA. Results: A cohort (GSE17536) of colorectal cancer patients showed that high LAYN expression was associated with poorer overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS). In addition, high LAYN expression was significantly correlated with poor OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in gastric cancers (OS HR = 1.97, P = 3.6e-10; PFS HR = 2.12, P = 2.3e-10). Moreover, LAYN significantly impacts the prognosis of diverse cancers via The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Specifically, high LAYN expression was correlated with worse OS and PFS in stage 2 to 4 but not stage 1 and stage N0 gastric cancer patients (P = 0.28, 0.34; P = 0.073, 0.092). LAYN expression was positively correlated with infiltrating levels of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells (DCs) in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD). LAYN expression showed strong correlations with diverse immune marker sets in COAD and STAD. Conclusions: These findings suggest that LAYN is correlated with prognosis and immune infiltrating levels of, including those of CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and DCs in multiple cancers, especially in colon and gastric cancer patients. In addition, LAYN expression potentially contributes to regulation of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), DCs, T cell exhaustion and Tregs in colon and gastric cancer. These findings suggest that LAYN can be used as a prognostic biomarker for determining prognosis and immune infiltration in gastric and colon cancers.},

Gene expression profiling and clinical characteristics of patients with CRC were retrieved from The Cancer Genome Atlas data portal. Immune cell infiltration was estimated based on single-sample gene set enrichment analysis. CRCs tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 90 consecutive cases of surgical samples were used for validation. Expression of CD8A and VEGFA was confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis with TMAs, and overall survival (OS) was analyzed. Expression profiling data demonstrated that CRC immune microenvironment from right side tumor was characterized as increased infiltration of immune cells with enhanced cytotoxic function, based on higher cytotoxic activity scores (CYT) and interferon-γ signatures. Expression of VEGFA, which could be neutralized by bevacizumab, was associated with decreased levels of activated CD8+ T-cells, Th1 cells, and PRF1 expression on the right side, but not on the left side. IHC analysis of TMAs further confirmed an inverse correlation between CD8A and VEGFA expression, and revealed a favorable OS for patients with CD8AHiVEGFALo disease among right-side CRCs. For the left side, higher CD56bright natural killer cell infiltration and active 4-1BB/IFN-ɑ signaling, which could providing a favorable condition for cetuximab-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity effect, was present in a cohort with extended OS. In the TME, features of immune phenotype sidedness were identified, providing an implication for differential responses to bevacizumab/cetuximab treatment. In addition, a new avenue for innovative experimental design and combinational immunotherapy to treat CRC patients was suggested.},

Although the identification of specific oncogenes has led to the development of clinically effective, molecularly targeted therapies in some cases, KRAS has remained refractory to this approach. A complementary strategy for targeting KRAS is to identify gene products that, when inhibited, result in cell death only in the presence of an oncogenic allele,. Here we have used systematic RNA interference (RNAi) to detect synthetic lethal partners of oncogenic KRAS and found that the non-canonical IκB kinase, TBK1, was selectively essential in cells that harbor mutant KRAS. Suppression of TBK1 induced apoptosis specifically in human cancer cell lines that depend on oncogenic KRAS expression. In these cells, TBK1 activated NF-κB anti-apoptotic signals involving cREL and BCL-XL that were essential for survival, providing mechanistic insights into this synthetic lethal interaction. These observations identify TBK1 and NF-κB signaling as essential in KRAS mutant tumors and establish a general approach for the rational identification of co-dependent pathways in cancer.},

	abstract = {Background
While large-scale cancer genomic projects are comprehensively characterizing the mutational spectrum of various cancers, so far little attention has been devoted to either define the antigenicity of these mutations or to characterize the immune responses they elicit. Here we present a strategy to characterize the immunophenotypes and the antigen-ome of human colorectal cancer.

Results
We apply our strategy to a large colorectal cancer cohort (n = 598) and show that subpopulations of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are associated with distinct molecular phenotypes. The characterization of the antigenome shows that a large number of cancer-germline antigens are expressed in all patients. In contrast, neo-antigens are rarely shared between patients, indicating that cancer vaccination requires individualized strategy. Analysis of the genetic basis of the tumors reveals distinct tumor escape mechanisms for the patient subgroups. Hypermutated tumors are depleted of immunosuppressive cells and show upregulation of immunoinhibitory molecules. Non-hypermutated tumors are enriched with immunosuppressive cells, and the expression of immunoinhibitors and MHC molecules is downregulated. Reconstruction of the interaction network of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and immunomodulatory molecules followed by a validation with 11 independent cohorts (n = 1,945) identifies BCMA as a novel druggable target. Finally, linear regression modeling identifies major determinants of tumor immunogenicity, which include well-characterized modulators as well as a novel candidate, CCR8, which is then tested in an orthologous immunodeficient mouse model.

Conclusions
The immunophenotypes of the tumors and the cancer antigenome remain widely unexplored, and our findings represent a step toward the development of personalized cancer immunotherapies.

A subset of these samples (97) underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome sequencing. In total, 16\% of colorectal carcinomas were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of these had the expected high microsatellite instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1 silencing, and one-quarter had somatic mismatch-repair gene and polymerase ε (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers, colon and rectum cancers were found to have considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration. Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number alterations include potentially drug-targetable amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT pathway member TCF7L1.

TP53 mutation can cause a range of changes in immune response, progression, and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Thus, we aim to build an immunoscore prognostic model that may enhance the prognosis of CRC from an immunological perspective. We estimated the proportion of immune cells in the GSE39582 public dataset using the CIBERSORT (Cell type identification by estimating relative subset of known RNA transcripts) algorithm. Prognostic genes that were used to establish the immunoscore model were generated by the LASSO (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) Cox regression model. We established and validated the immunoscore model in GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cohorts, respectively; significant differences of overall survival analysis were found between the low and high immunoscore groups or TP53 subgroups. In the multivariable Cox analysis, we observed that the immunoscore was an independent prognostic factor both in the GEO cohort (HR (Hazard ratio) 1.76, 95\% CI (confidence intervals): 1.26–2.46) and the TCGA cohort (HR 1.95, 95\% CI: 1.20–3.18). Furthermore, we established a nomogram for clinical application, and the results suggest that the nomogram is a better predictive model for prognosis than immunoscore or TNM staging.},

In this focused research review, we report MCP-counter, a methodology based on transcriptomic markers that assesses the proportion of several immune and stromal cell populations in the TME from transcriptomic data, and we highlight how it can provide a way to decipher the complex mechanisms at play in tumors. In several malignancies, MCP-counter scores have been used to show various prognostic impacts of the TME, which we also show to be linked with the mutational burden of tumors. We also compared established molecular classifications of colorectal cancer and clear-cell renal cell carcinoma with the output of MCP-counter, and show that molecular subgroups have different TME profiles, and that these profiles are consistent within a given subgroup.

	abstract = {Background
Accumulating evidence suggests immunomodulatory and context-dependent effects of TP53 mutations in cancer. We performed an exploratory analysis of the transcriptional, immunobiological and prognostic associations of TP53 mutations within the gene expression-based consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of colorectal cancer (CRC).

Materials and methods
In a single-hospital series of 401 stage I–IV primary CRCs, we sequenced the whole coding region of TP53 and analysed CMS-dependent transcriptional consequences of the mutations by gene expression profiling. Immunomodulatory associations were validated by multiplex, fluorescence-based immunohistochemistry of immune cell markers. Prognostic associations of TP53 mutations were analysed in an aggregated series of 635 patients classified according to CMS, including publicly available data from a French multicentre cohort (GSE39582).

Results
TP53 mutations were found in 60\% of the CRCs. However, gene set enrichment analyses indicated that their transcriptional consequences varied among the CMSs and were most pronounced in CMS1-immune and CMS4-mesenchymal. Subtype specificity was primarily seen as an upregulation of gene sets reflecting cell cycle progression in CMS4 and a downregulation of T cell activity in CMS1. The subtype-dependent immunomodulatory associations were reinforced by significant depletion of several immune cell populations in mutated tumours compared with wild-type (wt) tumours exclusively in CMS1, including cytotoxic lymphocytes (adjusted p value in CMS1=0.002 and CMS2−4{\textgreater}0.9, Microenvironment Cell Populations (MCP)-counter algorithm). This was validated by immunohistochemistry-based quantification of tumour infiltrating CD8+ cells. Within CMS1, the immunomodulatory association of TP53 mutations was strongest among microsatellite stable (MSS) tumours, and this translated into a propensity for metastatic disease and poor prognostic value of the mutations specifically in the CMS1/MSS subtype (both series overall survival: TP53 mutation vs wt: HR 5.52, p=0.028).

Conclusions
Integration of TP53 mutation status with the CMS framework in primary CRC suggested subtype-dependent immunobiological associations with prognostic and potentially immunotherapeutic implications, warranting independent validation.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The tumor microenvironment is formed by many distinct and interacting cell populations, and its composition may predict patients' prognosis and response to therapies. Colorectal cancer is a heterogeneous disease in which immune classifications and four consensus molecular subgroups (CMS) have been described. Our aim was to integrate the composition of the tumor microenvironment with the consensus molecular classification of colorectal cancer.
Experimental Design: We retrospectively analyzed the composition and the functional orientation of the immune, fibroblastic, and angiogenic microenvironment of 1,388 colorectal cancer tumors from three independent cohorts using transcriptomics. We validated our findings using immunohistochemistry.
Results: We report that colorectal cancer molecular subgroups and microenvironmental signatures are highly correlated. Out of the four molecular subgroups, two highly express immune-specific genes. The good-prognosis microsatellite instable–enriched subgroup (CMS1) is characterized by overexpression of genes specific to cytotoxic lymphocytes. In contrast, the poor-prognosis mesenchymal subgroup (CMS4) expresses markers of lymphocytes and of cells of monocytic origin. The mesenchymal subgroup also displays an angiogenic, inflammatory, and immunosuppressive signature, a coordinated pattern that we also found in breast (n = 254), ovarian (n = 97), lung (n = 80), and kidney (n = 143) cancers. Pathologic examination revealed that the mesenchymal subtype is characterized by a high density of fibroblasts that likely produce the chemokines and cytokines that favor tumor-associated inflammation and support angiogenesis, resulting in a poor prognosis. In contrast, the canonical (CMS2) and metabolic (CMS3) subtypes with intermediate prognosis exhibit low immune and inflammatory signatures.
Conclusions: The distinct immune orientations of the colorectal cancer molecular subtypes pave the way for tailored immunotherapies. Clin Cancer Res; 22(16); 4057–66. ©2016 AACR.},

Densities of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and innate cells increased, whereas most T cell densities decreased along with tumor progression. The number of B cells, which are key players in the core immune network and are associated with prolonged survival, increased at a late stage and showed a dual effect on recurrence and tumor progression. The immune control relevance was demonstrated in three endoscopic orthotopic colon-cancer mouse models. Genomic instability of the chemokine CXCL13 was a mechanism associated with Tfh and B cell infiltration. CXCL13 and IL21 were pivotal factors for the Tfh/B cell axis correlating with survival.

	abstract = {Cancer is a heterogeneous and complex disease. Tumours are formed by cancer cells and a myriad of non-cancerous cell types that together with the extracellular matrix form the tumour microenvironment. These cancer-associated cells and components contribute to shape the progression of cancer and are deeply involved in patient outcome. The immune system is an essential part of the tumour microenvironment, and induction of cancer immunotolerance is a necessary step involved in tumour formation and growth. Immune mechanisms are intimately associated with cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis; as well as to tumour dormancy and modulation of sensitivity to drug therapy. Transcriptome analyses have been extensively used to understand the heterogeneity of tumours, classifying tumours into molecular subtypes and establishing signatures that predict response to therapy and patient outcomes. However, the classification of the tumour cell diversity and specially the identification of rare populations has been limited in these transcriptomic analyses of bulk tumour cell populations. Massively-parallel single-cell RNAseq analysis has emerged as a powerful method to unravel heterogeneity and to study rare cell populations in cancer, through unsupervised sampling and modelling of transcriptional states in single cells. In this context, the study of the role of the immune system in cancer would benefit from single cell approaches, as it will enable the characterisation and/or discovery of the cell types and pathways involved in cancer immunotolerance otherwise missed in bulk transcriptomic information. Thus, the analysis of gene expression patterns at single cell resolution holds the potential to provide key information to develop precise and personalized cancer treatment including immunotherapy. This review is focused on the latest single-cell RNAseq methodologies able to agnostically study thousands of tumour cells as well as targeted single-cell RNAseq to study rare populations within tumours. In particular, we will discuss methods to study the immune system in cancer. We will also discuss the current challenges to the study of cancer at the single cell level and the potential solutions to the current approaches.},

Therefore, the quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells holds the promise to unveil the multi-faceted role of the immune system in human cancers and its involvement in tumor escape mechanisms and response to therapy. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can be quantified from RNA sequencing data of human tumors using bioinformatics approaches. In this review, we describe state-of-the-art computational methods for the quantification of immune cells from transcriptomics data and discuss the open challenges that must be addressed to accurately quantify immune infiltrates from RNA sequencing data of human bulk tumors.},

The introduction and use of these technologies had, and still have a prominent impact in the field of cancer immunotherapy, allowing delving deeper into the molecular and cellular crosstalk between cancer and immune system, and fostering the identification of predictive biomarkers of response.

Recently, a number of powerful computational tools for dissecting tumor-immune cell interactions from next-generation sequencing data have been developed. However, the assembly of analytical pipelines and execution of multi-step workflows are laborious and involve a large number of intermediate steps with many dependencies and parameter settings. Here we present TIminer, an easy-to-use computational pipeline for mining tumor-immune cell interactions from next-generation sequencing data. TIminer enables integrative immunogenomic analyses, including: human leukocyte antigens typing, neoantigen prediction, characterization of immune infiltrates and quantification of tumor immunogenicity.

	abstract = {Background
Understanding the interactions between tumor and the host immune system is critical to finding prognostic biomarkers, reducing drug resistance, and developing new therapies. Novel computational methods are needed to estimate tumor-infiltrating immune cells and understand tumor–immune interactions in cancers.

Results
We analyze tumor-infiltrating immune cells in over 10,000 RNA-seq samples across 23 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our computationally inferred immune infiltrates associate much more strongly with patient clinical features, viral infection status, and cancer genetic alterations than other computational approaches. Analysis of cancer/testis antigen expression and CD8 T-cell abundance suggests that MAGEA3 is a potential immune target in melanoma, but not in non-small cell lung cancer, and implicates SPAG5 as an alternative cancer vaccine target in multiple cancers. We find that melanomas expressing high levels of CTLA4 separate into two distinct groups with respect to CD8 T-cell infiltration, which might influence clinical responses to anti-CTLA4 agents. We observe similar dichotomy of TIM3 expression with respect to CD8 T cells in kidney cancer and validate it experimentally. The abundance of immune infiltration, together with our downstream analyses and findings, are accessible through TIMER, a public resource at http://cistrome.org/TIMER.

Conclusions
We develop a computational approach to study tumor-infiltrating immune cells and their interactions with cancer cells. Our resource of immune-infiltrate levels, clinical associations, as well as predicted therapeutic markers may inform effective cancer vaccine and checkpoint blockade therapies.

	abstract = {Immune cells infiltrating tumors can have important impact on tumor progression and response to therapy. We present an efficient algorithm to simultaneously estimate the fraction of cancer and immune cell types from bulk tumor gene expression data. Our method integrates novel gene expression profiles from each major non-malignant cell type found in tumors, renormalization based on cell-type-specific mRNA content, and the ability to consider uncharacterized and possibly highly variable cell types. Feasibility is demonstrated by validation with flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA-Seq analyses of human melanoma and colorectal tumor specimens. Altogether, our work not only improves accuracy but also broadens the scope of absolute cell fraction predictions from tumor gene expression data, and provides a unique novel experimental benchmark for immunogenomics analyses in cancer research (http://epic.gfellerlab.org)., Malignant tumors do not only contain cancer cells. Normal cells from the body also infiltrate tumors. These often include a variety of immune cells that can help detect and kill cancer cells. Many evidences suggest that the proportion of different immune cell types in a tumor can affect tumor growth and which treatments are effective., Researchers often study tumors by measuring the expression of genes, i.e., which genes are active in tumors. However, the proportion of different cell types in the tumor is often not measured for tumors studied at the gene expression level., Racle et al. have now demonstrated that a new computer-based tool can accurately detect all the main cell types in a tumor directly from the expression of genes in this tumor. The tool is called “Estimating the Proportion of Immune and Cancer cells” – or EPIC for short. It compares the level of expression of genes in a tumor with a library of the gene expression profiles from specific cell types that can be found in tumors and uses this information to predict how many of each type of cell are present. Experimental measurements of several human tumors confirmed that EPIC’s predictions are accurate., EPIC is freely available online. Since the active genes in tumors from many patients have already been documented together with clinical data, researchers could use EPIC to investigate whether the cell types in a tumor affect how harmful it is or how well a particular treatment works on it. In the future, this information could help to identify the best treatment for a particular patient and may reveal new genes that cause malignant tumors to develop and grow.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cancer killer in the US today and patients with metastatic disease have only a 14\% 5-year survival. One of the most impactful recent advances in cancer therapy, immune checkpoint inhibition, has not been shown to be effective for the majority of these patients. In this study, we use The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and recently developed informatic-based tools to identify targets for immune based therapy in colorectal cancer patients.
METHODS: Open access, pre-processed (level 3) mRNA data and clinical data from colorectal patients from the TCGA was downloaded from FireCloud. Using the Microenvironment Cell Populations-Counter method (MCP-Counter), cytotoxic lymphocyte scores were calculated for all patients. Patients were then grouped by cytotoxic lymphocyte score (High vs Low), pathologic stage, and location to identify differentially expressed genes. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Reactome to determine differentially expressed genes associated with immune pathways. Survival analysis was performed with identified differentially expressed genes.
RESULTS: In the TCGA dataset, there are 461 colon and 172 rectal cancer patients. After stratifying patients by cytotoxic lymphocyte score, anatomical location, and stage, we found a significant number of differentially expressed genes. We identified one pathway, "immunoregulatory interactions between a lymphoid and non-lymphoid cell", that was highly enriched and included in all tumor locations and stages. Survival analysis performed with differentially expressed genes in this pathway identified 21 different genes associated with survival and cytotoxic lymphocyte infiltration, with {\textasciitilde} 70\% of these genes occurring in the metastatic right-sided CRC group. Specifically, all genes associated with survival in the metastatic right-sided colorectal cancer group with low cytotoxic lymphocyte scores positively impacted survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing the TCGA, a publicly available dataset, and informatics-based analyses, we identified potential targets to improve immune based therapy in colorectal cancer. Additionally, we note the most targets in metastatic right-sided CRC patients, the patient group with the worst predicted survival. The results from this study demonstrate the ability of informatics-based analytic techniques to identify new therapeutic targets as well as improve patient selection for intervention, helping us to achieve the goals of precision-based oncology.},

This indicates the crucial role of miRNAs in maintaining biological and physiological processes. miR-7641 is a miRNA whose role in disease has not been fully investigated. In the present study, we investigated the expression pattern of miR-7641 and its target genes in different cancer cells, as well as in clinical cancer patients. Our data confirmed RPS16 and TNFSF10 as two direct targets of miR-7641, while gene expression study showed that a group of genes are also deregulated by miR-7641, including many ribosomal proteins that are frequently co-expressed with RPS16 in breast cancer. Direct inhibition of miR-7641 using a locked nucleic acid upregulated the expression of its target genes, sensitized cancer cells, and enhanced the efficiency of therapeutic agents such as doxorubicin. In addition, inhibition of miR-7641 boosted doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis of cancer cells via upregulation of apoptotic molecules Caspase 9 (CAS9) and poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) and downregulation of anti-apoptotic molecule BCL2. Thus, miR-7641 might be a clinically important cancer biomarker. Inhibition of miR-7641 expression could be an efficient treatment strategy for clinical patients.},

However, recent findings suggest that ribosome composition and activity may be more dynamically regulated to impart a new layer of specificity in the control of gene expression.Studies in several species have shown that 'specialized ribosomes' may exist, and that these ribosomes display heterogeneity in the composition and post-translational modifications of subsets of ribosomal proteins, variations in ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences or binding to distinct ribosome-associated factors. Greater variations in the translation machinery may have an substantial impact on how the genomic template is translated into functional proteins.Specific cis-acting 'translational regulons' within mRNAs may interface with specialized ribosomes to confer translational specificity. Examples of these elements include internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) and upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Moreover, even core ribosome components that show little variation may exert a more specialized activity by virtue of their interactions with these specific regulatory elements.Regulation in ribosome activity may provide an important new layer for control of gene expression in time and space that has an effect on cell and organismal biology as well as human disease.It will be important to conceptualize mRNA translation in the same light as transcriptional control — as a process in which enhancers or attenuators are likely to fine-tune protein abundance and that culminates in unique readouts with important biological significance.},

	abstract = {Ribosome biogenesis and translation are regulated at multiple levels and are associated with accurate cell growth and proliferation. The loss of key checkpoints during protein synthesis might contribute to the initiation and progression of cancer. During specific phases of the cell cycle, the synthesis of rRNA, as well as components of the protein synthesis machinery, is initiated by the phosphorylation of key transcription factors that regulate polymerase I (Pol I) and Pol III activity, respectively. This tight link between cell-cycle progression and protein synthesis exists to ensure accurate cell growth and proliferation, which might be lost in cancer cells. p53 and retinoblastoma (RB) repress Pol I and Pol III transcription. In cancer cells, which harbour inactivating mutations in these tumour suppressors, deregulation of Pol I and Pol III activity might contribute to tumorigenesis. Several ribosomal proteins are overexpressed in a variety of tumours. It remains to be determined whether this represents a cause or consequence of tumour formation. Increased phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal protein is thought to result in enhanced translation of specific mRNAs. This raises the possibility that deregulation of ribosomal proteins in tumours might affect the translation of specific target mRNAs. MYC and PTEN act as master regulators of ribosome biogenesis and translation control. Their deregulation in tumour cells increases the expression and activity of components of the translation apparatus. It remains to be determined which of the downstream targets of MYC and PTEN involved in controlling protein synthesis are directly responsible for tumour susceptibility. Further investigation will be needed to clarify to what extent deregulation in total or specific translation of mRNAs contributes to tumorigenesis. Although mutations in genes that are directly responsible for ribosome biogenesis, such as those encoding the ribosomal protein S19 and DKC1 (the enzyme that modifies rRNA), have been found in cancer susceptibility syndromes, the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins cause cancer remain largely unknown. Components of the translation machinery that are overexpressed or deregulated in cancer cells could represent targets for cancer therapy. The macrolide rapamycin, which affects the translation machinery, has already been used in clinical trials as a tumour inhibitory agent.},

Recent findings have shifted this obsolete view, revealing a remarkably complex and multifaceted machinery whose role is to orchestrate spatiotemporal control of gene expression. Ribosome specialization discovery has raised the interesting possibility of the existence of its malignant counterpart, an 'oncogenic' ribosome, which may promote tumor progression. Here we weigh the arguments supporting the existence of an 'oncogenic' ribosome and evaluate its role in cancer evolution. In particular, we provide an analysis and perspective on how the ribosome may play a critical role in the acquisition and maintenance of cancer stem cell phenotype.},

	abstract = {Glioblastoma stem cells (GSC) co-exhibiting a tumor-initiating capacity and a radio-chemoresistant phenotype, are a compelling cell model for explaining tumor recurrence. We have previously characterized patient-derived, treatment-resistant GSC clones (TRGC) that survived radiochemotherapy. Compared to glucose-dependent, treatment-sensitive GSC clones (TSGC), TRGC exhibited reduced glucose dependence that favor the fatty acid oxidation pathway as their energy source. Using comparative genome-wide transcriptome analysis, a series of defense signatures associated with TRGC survival were identified and verified by siRNA-based gene knockdown experiments that led to loss of cell integrity. In this study, we investigate the prognostic value of defense signatures in glioblastoma (GBM) patients using gene expression analysis with Probeset Analyzer (131 GBM) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data, and protein expression with a tissue microarray (50 GBM), yielding the first TRGC-derived prognostic biomarkers for GBM patients. Ribosomal protein S11 (RPS11), RPS20, individually and together, consistently predicted poor survival of newly diagnosed primary GBM tumors when overexpressed at the RNA or protein level [RPS11: Hazard Ratio (HR) = 11.5, p{\textless}0.001; RPS20: HR = 4.5, p = 0.03; RPS11+RPS20: HR = 17.99, p = 0.001]. The prognostic significance of RPS11 and RPS20 was further supported by whole tissue section RPS11 immunostaining (27 GBM; HR = 4.05, p = 0.01) and TCGA gene expression data (578 primary GBM; RPS11: HR = 1.19, p = 0.06; RPS20: HR = 1.25, p = 0.02; RPS11+RPS20: HR = 1.43, p = 0.01). Moreover, tumors that exhibited unmethylated O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) or wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) were associated with higher RPS11 expression levels [corr (IDH1, RPS11) = 0.64, p = 0.03); [corr (MGMT, RPS11) = 0.52, p = 0.04]. These data indicate that increased expression of RPS11 and RPS20 predicts shorter patient survival. The study also suggests that TRGC are clinically relevant cells that represent resistant tumorigenic clones from patient tumors and that their properties, at least in part, are reflected in poor-prognosis GBM. The screening of TRGC signatures may represent a novel alternative strategy for identifying new prognostic biomarkers.},

	abstract = {Ribosome biogenesis is the most demanding energetic and metabolic expenditure of the cell. The nucleolus, a nuclear compartment, coordinates rRNA transcription, maturation, and assembly into ribosome subunits. The transcription process is highly coordinated with ribosome biogenesis. In this context, ribosomal proteins (RPs) play a crucial role. In the last decade, an increasing number of studies have associated RPs with extraribosomal functions related to proliferation. Importantly, the expression of RPs appears to be deregulated in several human disorders due, at least in part, to genetic mutations. Although the deregulation of RPs in human malignancies is commonly observed, a more complex mechanism is believed to be involved, favoring the tumorigenic process, its progression and metastasis. This review explores the roles of the most frequently mutated oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in human cancer that modulate ribosome biogenesis, including their interaction with RPs. In this regard, we propose a new focus for novel therapies.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant tumors. Invasion and metastasis can occur in the early stage of pancreatic cancer, contributing to the poor prognosis. Accordingly, in this study, we evaluated the molecular mechanisms underlying invasion and metastasis. Using mass spectrometry, we found that Integrin alpha 6 (ITGA6) was more highly expressed in a highly invasive pancreatic cancer cell line (PC-1.0) than in a less invasive cell line (PC-1). Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, we observed significant decreases in invasion and metastasis in pancreatic cancer cells after inhibiting ITGA6. Based on data in TCGA, high ITGA6 expression significantly predicted poor prognosis. By using Co-IP combined mass spectrometry, we found that ribosomal protein SA (RPSA), which was also highly expressed in PC-1.0, interacted with ITGA6. Similar to ITGA6, high RPSA expression promoted invasion and metastasis and indicated poor prognosis. Interestingly, although ITGA6 and RPSA interacted, they did not mutually regulate each other. ITGA6 and RPSA affected invasion and metastasis via the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, respectively. Inhibiting ITGA6 significantly reduced the expression of p-AKT, while inhibiting RPSA led to the downregulation of p-ERK1/2. Compared with the inhibition of ITGA6 or RPSA alone, the downregulation of both ITGA6 and RPSA weakened invasion and metastasis to a greater extent and led to the simultaneous downregulation of p-AKT and p-ERK1/2. Our research indicates that the development of drugs targeting both ITGA6 and RPSA may be an effective strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.},

	abstract = {Background: Cancer metastasis is the major reason for cancer related deaths, and the mechanism of cancer metastasis still unclear. RPLP1, a member of a group of proteins known as ribosomal proteins, is associated with tumorigenesis and primary cell immortalization and is involved in cellular transformation. However, the expression and potential function of RPLP1 in TNBC remain unclear.
Methods: The expression of RPLP1 in TNBC tissues and cell lines were detected with Real-Time PCR and western blotting. 81 cases of TNBC tissue samples and adjacent non-tumor tissue samples were tested by immunochemistry to determine the correlation between the RPLP1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics. In vitro, we determined the role and mechanistic pathways of RPLP1 in tumor metastasis in TNBC cell lines.
Results: In this study, we detected high levels of RPLP1 expression in TNBC samples and cell lines. RPLP1 is upregulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) tissues and cells, and high expression levels correlate with an increased risk of recurrence and metastasis. Furthermore, high RPLP1 expression was associated with a poor prognosis and was an independent prognostic marker for TNBC. In RPLP1-induced cancer metastasis, RPLP1 may increase cancer cell invasion, which is likely the result of its effect on the cancer cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
Conclusions: Altogether, our findings indicate RPLP1 is a poor prognostic potential biomarker and anti-metastasis candidate therapeutic target in triple-negative breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Despite recent advances in targeted and immune-based therapies, the poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) with bone metastasis (BM) remains a challenge. First, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) was used to identify proteins that were differentially expressed in LUAD with BM, and then matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) was used to identify these proteins. Second, the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was used to identify mutations in these differentially expressed proteins and Kaplan-Meier plotter (KM Plotter) was used to generate survival curves for the analyzed cases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to check the expression of proteins in 28 patients with BM and nine patients with LUAD. Lastly, the results were analyzed with respect to clinical features and patient's follow-up. We identified a number of matched proteins from 2-DE. High expression of enolase 1 (ENO1) (HR = 1.67, logrank P = 1.9E-05), ribosomal protein lateral stalk subunit P2 (RPLP2) (HR = 1.77, logrank P = 2.9e-06), and NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 2 (NME1-NME2) (HR = 2.65, logrank P = 3.9E-15) was all significantly associated with poor survival (P {\textless} 0.05). Further, ENO1 was upregulated (P = 0.0004) and calcyphosine (CAPS1) was downregulated (P = 5.34E-07) in TCGA LUAD RNA-seq expression data. IHC revealed that prominent ENO1 staining (OR = 7.5, P = 0.034) and low levels of CAPS1 (OR = 0.01, P {\textless} 0.0001) staining were associated with BM incidence. Finally, we found that LUAD patients with high expression of ENO1 and RPLP2 had worse overall survival. This is the first instance where the genes ENO1, RPLP2, NME1-NME2 and CAPS1 were associated with disease severity and progression in LUAD patients with BM.

To elucidate molecular mechanism associated with the metastasis of colorectal cancer, genes related to the metastasis time of colorectal cancer were screened. Then, a network was constructed with this genes. Data was obtained from colorectal cancer expression profile. Molecular mechanism elucidated the time of tumor metastasis and the expression of genes related to colorectal cancer. We found that metastasis-promoting and metastasis-inhibiting networks included protein hubs of high connectivity. These protein hubs were components of organelles. Some ribosomal proteins promoted the metastasis of colorectal cancer. In some components of organelles, such as proteasomes, mitochondrial ribosome, ATP synthase, and splicing factors, the metastasis of colorectal cancer was inhibited by some sections of these organelles. After performing survival analysis of proteins in organelles, joint survival curve of proteins was constructed in ribosomal network. This joint survival curve showed metastasis was promoted in patients with colorectal cancer (P = 0.0022939). Joint survival curve of proteins was plotted against proteasomes (P = 7 e-07), mitochondrial ribosome (P = 0.0001157), ATP synthase (P = 0.0001936), and splicing factors (P = 1.35e-05). These curves indicate that metastasis of colorectal cancer can be inhibited.

Here we show that human primary lung adenocarcinomas are characterized by the emergence of regenerative cell types, typically seen in response to lung injury, and by striking infidelity among transcription factors specifying most alveolar and bronchial epithelial lineages. In contrast, metastases are enriched for key endoderm and lung-specifying transcription factors, SOX2 and SOX9, and recapitulate more primitive transcriptional programs spanning stem-like to regenerative pulmonary epithelial progenitor states. This developmental continuum mirrors the progressive stages of spontaneous outbreak from metastatic dormancy in a mouse model and exhibits SOX9-dependent resistance to natural killer cells. Loss of developmental stage-specific constraint in macrometastases triggered by natural killer cell depletion suggests a dynamic interplay between developmental plasticity and immune-mediated pruning during metastasis.},

Here, we review recent single-cell CTC (scCTC) sequencing efforts, and the integrated workflows, that have successfully characterized patient-derived CTCs. We examine how these studies uncover DNA alterations occurring at multiple molecular levels ranging from point mutations to chromosomal rearrangements from a single CTC, and discuss their cellular heterogeneity and clinical consequences.

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is among the top 3 leading causes of cancer-related deaths, and tumor malignant progression and metastases contribute to the high mortality of advanced CRC. Immune components in the tumor microenvironment can modulate tumor progression and are attractive therapeutic targets. Recently, intra-tumor mutational diversification of colorectal cancer cells at the single cell level was conducted. However, single cell transcriptome analysis of the microenvironment composition and characteristics in CRC liver metastases has yet to be performed. In this study, samples of liver metastasis cancer tissue and adjacent tissue from CRC patients were examined by single cell RNA sequencing. A total of 12 clusters corresponding to 6 cell types, including cancer cells, T cells, myeloid cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts and B cells, were identified. Expression clustering of 445 cell cluster deregulated genes (CCDGs) identified 6 gene modules and functional enrichment was conducted to analyse the pathways in cancer cell and T cell populations. Next, the clinical significance of the expression of 93 cell cluster specifically deregulated genes (CCSDGs) in tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the correlation of the expression of these genes with patients’ survival rates were investigated with the TCGA dataset. Then, the mechanisms for increased proportion of granulocytes in the cancer sample were explored, and abnormal ferroptosis-mediated granulocyte cell death was proposed. Finally, the Wnt signalling pathway was found to be activated and promote granulocytes migration. This single cell RNA sequencing study may shed light on the tumor microenvironment composition and pave the way for CRC liver metastasis therapy.},

	abstract = {Relatively little is known about factors that initiate immunosuppression
in tumors and act at the interface between tumor cells and host cells. In this
article, we report novel immunosuppressive properties of the ribosomal protein
S19 (RPS19), which is upregulated in human breast and ovarian cancer cells and
released from apoptotic tumor cells, whereupon it interacts with the complement
C5a receptor 1 (C5aR1) expressed on tumor infiltrating myeloid-derived
suppressor cells (MDSC). This interaction promotes tumor growth by facilitating
recruitment of these cells to tumors. RPS19 also induces the production of
immunosuppressive cytokines including TGF-β by MDSC in tumor draining
lymph nodes, leading to T cell responses skewed toward TH2
phenotypes. RPS19 promotes generation of T regulatory cells while reducing
infiltration of CD8+T cells into tumors. Reducing RPS19 in
tumor cells or blocking the C5aR1-RPS19 interaction decreases RPS19-mediated
immunosuppression, impairs tumor growth, and delays the development of tumors in
a transgenic model of breast cancer. This work provides an initial preclinical
evidence for targeting RPS19 for anticancer therapy enhancing antitumor T cell
responses.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tumor associated antigens are useful in colorectal cancer (CRC) management. The ribosomal P proteins (P0, P1, P2) play an important role in protein synthesis and tumor formation. The immunogenicity of the ribosomal P0 protein in head and neck, in breast and prostate cancer patients and the overexpression of the carboxyl-terminal P0 epitope (C-22 P0) in some tumors were reported.
METHODS: Sera from 72 colorectal tumor patients (67 malignant and 5 benign tumors) were compared with 73 healthy donor sera for the presence of antibodies to CEA, EGFR, ErbB2 and ribosomal P proteins by western blotting or ELISA. Expression of the C-22 P0 epitope on tissues and colon cancer cells was determined by immunoperoxidase staining and indirect immunofluorescence/western blotting, respectively, employing MAb 2B2. Biological effects of MAb 2B2 on colon cancer cells were assessed by the Sulforhodamine B cell proliferation assay, trypan blue exclusion test and cleaved caspase-3 detection. Fisher's exact test was used to compare the number of auto-antibodies positive patients with healthy donors. Variation in the C-22 P0 expression, and in the number of apoptotic cells was evaluated by Student's t-test. Variation in cell survival and cell death was evaluated by Newman-Keuls test.
RESULTS: No significant humoral response was observed to CEA, EGFR and ErbB2 in CRC patients. Conversely, 7 out of 67 CRC patient sera reacted to ribosomal P proteins. The prevalence of P proteins auto-antibodies in CRC patients was significant. Five patients showed restricted P0 immunoreactivity, while two patients reacted simultaneously to all P proteins. The C-22 P0 epitope was homogenously expressed both in malignant tumors and the adjacent mucosa, but the intensity of expression was higher in the tumor. Starved colon cancer cells showed a higher C-22 P0 epitope plasma membrane expression compared to control cells. MAb 2B2 inhibited colon cancer cell growth and induced cell death in a dose dependent manner.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows a spontaneous humoral immune response to ribosomal P0 protein in CRC patients and the inhibition of in vitro cancer cell growth after C-22 P0 epitope targeting. The ribosomal P0 protein might be a useful immunological target in CRC patients.},

These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of “hallmark” gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a “refined” gene set, derived from multiple “founder” sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.,},

The Notch signaling pathway serves important roles in cell fate determination, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Increasing evidence supports the association of Notch signaling dysregulation with various types of malignant tumor, including NSCLC. Several studies have demonstrated that members of the Notch signaling pathway may be potential biomarkers for predicting the progression and prognosis of patients with NSCLC. Furthermore, Notch signaling serves critical roles in the tumorigenesis and treatment resistance of NSCLC cells by promoting the proliferation or inhibiting the apoptosis of NSCLC cells.

The enormous T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, which is required for the recognition of foreign and self-antigens2, could serve as lineage tags to track these T cells in tumours3. Here we obtained transcriptomes of 11,138 single T cells from 12 patients with colorectal cancer, and developed single T cell analysis by RNA sequencing and TCR tracking (STARTRAC) indices to quantitatively analyse the dynamic relationships among 20 identified T cell subsets with distinct functions and clonalities. Although both CD8+ effector and ‘exhausted’ T cells exhibited high clonal expansion, they were independently connected with tumour-resident CD8+ effector memory cells, implicating a TCR-based fate decision. Of the CD4+ T cells, most tumour-infiltrating T regulatory (Treg) cells showed clonal exclusivity, whereas certain Treg cell clones were developmentally linked to several T helper (TH) cell clones. Notably, we identified two IFNG+ TH1-like cell clusters in tumours that were associated with distinct IFNγ-regulating transcription factors —the GZMK+ effector memory T cells, which were associated with EOMES and RUNX3, and CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cell clusters, which were associated with BHLHE40. Only CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cells were preferentially enriched in patients with microsatellite-instable tumours, and this might explain their favourable responses to immune-checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, IGFLR1 was highly expressed in both CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cells and CD8+ exhausted T cells and possessed co-stimulatory functions. Our integrated STARTRAC analyses provide a powerful approach to dissect the T cell properties in colorectal cancer comprehensively, and could provide insights into the dynamic relationships of T cells in other cancers.},

Time series from single cell assays are particularly susceptible to confounding as the measurements are not averaged over populations of cells. When several genes are assayed in parallel these effects can be estimated and corrected for under certain smoothness assumptions on cell progression. , Results: We present a principled probabilistic model with a Bayesian inference scheme to analyse such data. We demonstrate our method’s utility on public microarray, nCounter and RNA-seq datasets from three organisms. Our method almost perfectly recovers withheld capture times in an Arabidopsis dataset, it accurately estimates cell cycle peak times in a human prostate cancer cell line and it correctly identifies two precocious cells in a study of paracrine signalling in mouse dendritic cells. Furthermore, our method compares favourably with Monocle, a state-of-the-art technique. We also show using held-out data that uncertainty in the temporal dimension is a common confounder and should be accounted for in analyses of repeated cross-sectional time series., Availability and Implementation: Our method is available on CRAN in the DeLorean package., Contact:

	abstract = {The majority of patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) colorectal cancer (CRC) do not benefit from the immunotherapies directed at rescuing T-cell functions. Therefore, complete understanding of T-cell phenotypes and functional status in the CRC microenvironment is desirable. Here, we applied single-cell mass cytometry to mold the T-cell phenotype in 18 patients with MSS CRC for better understanding of CRC as a systemic disease and to search for tumor-driven T-cell profile changes. We show interpatient and intrapatient phenotypic diversity of T-cell subsets. We revealed increased immunosuppressive/exhausted T-cell phenotypes at tumor lesions. CD8+ CD28− immunosenescent T cells with impaired proliferation capacity dominate the T-cell compartment. As per the transcriptome and quantitative real time-PCR analysis, the accumulation of immunosuppressive cells is driven by the tumor microenvironment. T-cell profiles are similar between patients at early and late stages, indicating that the immunosuppressive microenvironment is formulated early during CRC development. Mapping of T-cell infiltration and understanding of the mechanisms underlying their regulation may provide valuable information to boost the immune response in patients with MSS CRC.},

Computational techniques have arisen from single-cell ‘omics and cancer modelling where pseudotime can be used to learn about cellular differentiation or tumour progression. However, methods to date typically implicitly assume homogeneous genetic, phenotypic or environmental backgrounds, which becomes limiting as data sets grow in size and complexity. We describe a novel statistical framework that learns how pseudotime trajectories can be modulated through covariates that encode such factors. We apply this model to both single-cell and bulk gene expression data sets and show that the approach can recover known and novel covariate-pseudotime interaction effects. This hybrid regression-latent variable model framework extends pseudotemporal modelling from its most prevalent area of single cell genomics to wider applications.},

Herein, with scWES and matched bulk whole-exome sequencing (bulk WES) on two colorectal cancer (CRC) patients with normal or adenomatous polyps, we found that both the adenoma and cancer were of monoclonal origin, and both shared partial mutations in the same signaling pathways, but each showed a specific spectrum of heterogeneous somatic mutations. In addition, the adenoma and cancer further developed intratumor heterogeneity with the accumulation of nonrandom somatic mutations specifically in GPCR, PI3K-Akt and FGFR signaling pathways. We identified novel driver mutations that developed during adenoma and cancer evolution, particularly in OR1B1 (GPCR signaling pathway) for adenoma evolution, and LAMA1 (PI3K-Akt signaling pathway) and ADCY3 (FGFR signaling pathway) for CRC evolution. In summary, we demonstrated that both colorectal adenoma and CRC are monoclonal in origin, and the CRCs further diversified into different subclones with heterogeneous mutation profiles accumulating in GPCR, PI3K-Akt and FGFR signaling pathways. ScWES provides evidence for the importance of mutations in certain pathways that would not be as apparent from bulk sequencing of tumors, and can potentially establish whether specific mutations are mutually exclusive or occur sequentially in the same subclone of cells.},

Here, we present a strategy that enables simultaneous analysis of TCR sequences and corresponding full transcriptomes from 3′-barcoded scRNA-seq samples. This approach is compatible with common 3′ scRNA-seq methods, and adaptable to processed samples post hoc. We applied the technique to identify transcriptional signatures associated with T cells sharing common TCRs from immunized mice and from patients with food allergy. We observed preferential phenotypes among subsets of expanded clonotypes, including type 2 helper CD4+ T cell (TH2) states associated with food allergy. These results demonstrate the utility of our method when studying diseases in which clonotype-driven responses are critical to understanding the underlying biology.},

This ability is achieved during thymic development through a complex molecular mechanism based on somatic recombination that lead to the expression of a very heterogeneous population of surface antigen receptors, the T Cell Receptors or TCRs. TCRs are cell specific and represent a sort of “molecular tag” of T cells and have been widely studied to monitor the dynamics of T cells in terms of clonality and diversity in several contexts including lymphoid malignancies, infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and tumor immunology. In this review, we provide an overview of the strategies used to investigate the TCR repertoire from the pioneering techniques based on the V segments identification to the revolution introduced by Next Generation Sequencing that allows for high-throughput sequencing of alpha and beta chains. Single cell based approaches brought the analysis to a higher level of complexity and now provide the opportunity to sequence paired alpha and beta chains. We also discuss novel approaches that through the integration of TCR tracking and mRNA single-cell sequencing offer a valuable tool to associate antigen specificity to transcriptional dynamics and to understand the molecular mechanisms of T cell plasticity.},

	abstract = {Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can mediate responses in some patients with metastatic epithelial cancer. Identifying gene signatures associated with successful ACT might enable the development of improved therapeutic approaches. The persistence of transferred T cells in the peripheral blood is one indication of clinical effectiveness, but many T-cell and host factors may influence T-cell persistence. To limit these variables, we previously studied a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with polyclonal TILs targeting the KRAS(G12D) hotspot mutation, who experienced a partial response for 9 months. Three dominant clonotypes specifically recognizing KRAS(G12D) epitopes were identified, but we found that only two clonotypes persisted 40 days after ACT. Because of these findings, in this study, we performed the single-cell transcriptome analysis of the infused TILs. The analysis revealed a total of 472 genes that were differentially expressed between clonotypes 9.1-NP and 9.2-P single cells, and 528 genes between 9.1-NP and 10-P. Following these clonotypes in the peripheral blood after ACT, the gene expression patterns changed, but IL7R, ITGB1, KLF2 and ZNF683 remained expressed in the persistent 9.2-P and 10-P cells, compared to the non-persistent 9.1-NP cells. Additionally, four autologous TILs, which were used for treatment but persisted poorly one month after ACT, did not express the gene profiles associated with persistence. These results suggest that certain TIL populations possess a unique gene expression profile that can lead to the persistence of T cells. Thus, this single-patient study provides an insight on how to improve ACT for solid cancer.},

We leverage somatic mtDNA mutations as natural genetic barcodes and demonstrate their utility as highly accurate clonal markers to infer cellular relationships. We track native human cells both in vitro and in vivo and relate clonal dynamics to gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Our approach should allow clonal tracking at a 1,000-fold greater scale than with nuclear genome sequencing, with simultaneous information on cell state, opening the way to chart cellular dynamics in human health and disease.},

The absence of APC and TP53 mutations in the minor clone supports that these two clones were derived from two cellular origins. Examination of somatic mutation allele frequency spectra of additional 21 whole-tissue exome-sequenced cases revealed the heterogeneity of clonal origins in colon cancer. Next, we identified a mutated gene SLC12A5 that showed a high frequency of mutation at the single-cell level but exhibited low prevalence at the population level. Functional characterization of mutant SLC12A5 revealed its potential oncogenic effect in colon cancer. Our study provides the first exome-wide evidence at single-cell level supporting that colon cancer could be of a biclonal origin, and suggests that low-prevalence mutations in a cohort may also play important protumorigenic roles at the individual level.},

We show that human colon cancer tissues contain distinct cell populations whose transcriptional identities mirror those of the different cellular lineages of normal colon. By creating monoclonal tumor xenografts from injection of a single-cell (n = 1), we show that transcriptional diversity of cancer tissues is largely explained by in vivo multi-lineage differentiation, not only by clonal genetic heterogeneity. Finally, we show that perturbations in gene-expression programs linked to multi-lineage differentiation strongly associate with patient survival. Guided by SINCE-PCR data, we develop two-gene classifier systems (KRT20 vs CA1, MS4A12, CD177, SLC26A3) that predict clinical outcomes with hazard-ratios superior to pathological grade and comparable to microarray-derived multi-gene expression signatures.},

We argue that mass cytometry occupies an important niche within the landscape of single-cell analysis platforms that enables the efficient and in-depth study of diverse immune cell subsets with an ability to zoom-in on myeloid and lymphoid compartments in various tissues in health and disease. We further discuss the unique features of mass cytometry that are favorable for combining multiplex peptide-MHC multimer technology and phenotypic characterization of antigen specific T cells. By referring to recent studies revealing the complexities of tumor immune infiltrates, we highlight the particular importance of this technology for studying cancer in the context of cancer immunotherapy.

However, the details of the adaptive immune reaction to these tumors are poorly understood. We have accrued both colon tumor samples and adjacent healthy mucosal samples from 15 CRC patients to study lymphocytes infiltrating these tissues. We apply a method for detailed sequencing of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in CRC tumors at high throughput to probe T-cell clones in comparison with the TCRs from adjacent healthy mucosal tissue. In parallel, we captured TIL counts using standard immunohistochemistry. The variation in diversity of the TIL repertoire was far wider than the variation of T-cell clones in the healthy mucosa, and the oligoclonality was higher on average in the tumors. However, the diversity of the T-cell repertoire in both CRC tumors and healthy mucosa was on average 100-fold lower than in peripheral blood. Using the TCR sequences to identify and track clones between mucosal and tumor samples, we determined that the immune response in the tumor is different than in the adjacent mucosal tissue, and the number of shared clones is not dependent on distance between the samples. Together, these data imply that CRC tumors induce a specific adaptive immune response, but that this response differs widely in strength and breadth between patients.},

	abstract = {The adaptive immune system uses several strategies to generate a repertoire of T- and B-cell antigen receptors with sufficient diversity to recognize the universe of potential pathogens. In αβ T cells, which primarily recognize peptide antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex molecules, most of this receptor diversity is contained within the third complementarity-determining region (CDR3) of the T-cell receptor (TCR) α and β chains. Although it has been estimated that the adaptive immune system can generate up to 1016 distinct αβ pairs, direct assessment of TCR CDR3 diversity has not proved amenable to standard capillary electrophoresis-based DNA sequencing. We developed a novel experimental and computational approach to measure TCR CDR3 diversity based on single-molecule DNA sequencing, and used this approach to determine the CDR3 sequence in millions of rearranged TCRβ genes from T cells of 2 adults. We find that total TCRβ receptor diversity is at least 4-fold higher than previous estimates, and the diversity in the subset of CD45RO+ antigen-experienced αβ T cells is at least 10-fold higher than previous estimates. These methods should prove valuable for assessment of αβ T-cell repertoire diversity after hematopoietic cell transplantation, in states of congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, and during normal aging.},

TDLNs are also considered as a tissue to activate the antitumor immunity, where antigen-specific effector T cells are generated. However, T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires in TDLNs have not been well characterized. We collected 23 colorectal cancer tumors with 203 lymph nodes with/without metastatic cancer cells (67 were metastasis-positive and the remaining 136 were metastasis-negative) and performed TCR sequencing. Metastasis-positive TDLNs showed a significantly lower TCR diversity and shared TCR clonotypes more frequently with primary tumor tissues compared to metastasis-negative TDLNs. Principal component analysis indicated that TDLNs with metastasis showed similar TCR repertoires. These findings suggest that cancer-reactive T cell clones could be enriched in the metastasis-positive TDLNs.},

We analyzed 37,931 single T cells with respect to transcriptome, TCR sequence and 23 cell surface proteins, from tumors and adjacent normal colon of 16 patients. Our comprehensive analysis revealed two phenotypically distinct cytotoxic T cell populations within tumors. Its main population transitioned from one positively prognostic effector memory to the other non-prognostic resident memory population in a stage-dependent manner. We further defined several Treg subpopulations within tumors. While Tregs overall were associated with positive clinical outcomes, the CD38$^{\textrm{+}}$ peripherally-derived Treg subpopulation, phenotypically related to Th17 cells, correlated with poor outcomes independent of cancer stage.

	abstract = {Background
Recent innovations in single-cell Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) enable profiling of the epigenetic landscape of thousands of individual cells. scATAC-seq data analysis presents unique methodological challenges. scATAC-seq experiments sample DNA, which, due to low copy numbers (diploid in humans), lead to inherent data sparsity (1–10\% of peaks detected per cell) compared to transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) data (10–45\% of expressed genes detected per cell). Such challenges in data generation emphasize the need for informative features to assess cell heterogeneity at the chromatin level.

Results
We present a benchmarking framework that is applied to 10 computational methods for scATAC-seq on 13 synthetic and real datasets from different assays, profiling cell types from diverse tissues and organisms. Methods for processing and featurizing scATAC-seq data were compared by their ability to discriminate cell types when combined with common unsupervised clustering approaches. We rank evaluated methods and discuss computational challenges associated with scATAC-seq analysis including inherently sparse data, determination of features, peak calling, the effects of sequencing coverage and noise, and clustering performance. Running times and memory requirements are also discussed.

Conclusions
This reference summary of scATAC-seq methods offers recommendations for best practices with consideration for both the non-expert user and the methods developer. Despite variation across methods and datasets, SnapATAC, Cusanovich2018, and cisTopic outperform other methods in separating cell populations of different coverages and noise levels in both synthetic and real datasets. Notably, SnapATAC is the only method able to analyze a large dataset ({\textgreater} 80,000 cells).},

To define the underlining regulatory dynamics, we analyze high-resolution time courses of ibrutinib treatment in patients with CLL, combining immune-phenotyping, single-cell transcriptome profiling, and chromatin mapping. We identify a consistent regulatory program starting with a sharp decrease of NF-κB binding in CLL cells, which is followed by reduced activity of lineage-defining transcription factors, erosion of CLL cell identity, and acquisition of a quiescence-like gene signature. We observe patient-to-patient variation in the speed of execution of this program, which we exploit to predict patient-specific dynamics in the response to ibrutinib based on the pre-treatment patient samples. In aggregate, our study describes time-dependent cellular, molecular, and regulatory effects for therapeutic inhibition of B cell receptor signaling in CLL, and it establishes a broadly applicable method for epigenome/transcriptome-based treatment monitoring.},

Signac enables an end-to-end analysis of single-cell chromatin data, including peak calling, quantification, quality control, dimension reduction, clustering, integration with single-cell gene expression datasets, DNA motif analysis, and interactive visualization. Furthermore, Signac facilitates the analysis of multimodal single-cell chromatin data, including datasets that co-assay DNA accessibility with gene expression, protein abundance, and mitochondrial genotype. We demonstrate scaling of the Signac framework to datasets containing over 700,000 cells.

Currently, the Cistrome DB contains approximately 47,000 human and mouse samples with about 24,000 newly collected datasets compared to the previous release two years ago. Furthermore, the Cistrome DB has a new Toolkit module with several features that allow users to better utilize the large-scale ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq data. First, users can query the factors which are likely to regulate a specific gene of interest. Second, the Cistrome DB Toolkit facilitates searches for factor binding, histone modifications, and chromatin accessibility in any given genomic interval shorter than 2Mb. Third, the Toolkit can determine the most similar ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq samples in terms of genomic interval overlaps with user-provided genomic interval sets. The Cistrome DB is a user-friendly, up-to-date, and well maintained resource, and the new tools will greatly benefit the biomedical research community.

Mapping gene expression at the single-cell level within tissues remains a technical challenge. Rodriques et al. developed a method called Slide-seq, whereby RNA was spatially resolved from tissue sections by transfer onto a surface covered with DNA-barcoded beads. Applying Slide-seq to regions of a mouse brain revealed spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of the cerebellum and axes of variation across Purkinje cell compartments. The authors used this method to dissect the temporal evolution of cell type–specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury.
Science, this issue p. 1463
Spatial positions of cells in tissues strongly influence function, yet a high-throughput, genome-wide readout of gene expression with cellular resolution is lacking. We developed Slide-seq, a method for transferring RNA from tissue sections onto a surface covered in DNA-barcoded beads with known positions, allowing the locations of the RNA to be inferred by sequencing. Using Slide-seq, we localized cell types identified by single-cell RNA sequencing datasets within the cerebellum and hippocampus, characterized spatial gene expression patterns in the Purkinje layer of mouse cerebellum, and defined the temporal evolution of cell type–specific responses in a mouse model of traumatic brain injury. These studies highlight how Slide-seq provides a scalable method for obtaining spatially resolved gene expression data at resolutions comparable to the sizes of individual cells.
An RNA sequencing technique is developed that can measure genome-wide gene expression in complex tissues at 10-micrometer resolution.

Integration of single-cell and spatial data mapped ligand-receptor networks to specific cell types, revealing TSK cells as a hub for intercellular communication. Multiple features of potential immunosuppression were observed, including T regulatory cell (Treg) co-localization with CD8 T cells in compartmentalized tumor stroma. Finally, single-cell characterization of human tumor xenografts and in vivo CRISPR screens identified essential roles for specific tumor subpopulation-enriched gene networks in tumorigenesis.

	abstract = {Background
Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are abundant in gliomas and immunosuppressive TAMs are a barrier to emerging immunotherapies. It is unknown to what extent macrophages derived from peripheral blood adopt the phenotype of brain-resident microglia in pre-treatment gliomas. The relative proportions of blood-derived macrophages and microglia have been poorly quantified in clinical samples due to a paucity of markers that distinguish these cell types in malignant tissue.

Results
We perform single-cell RNA-sequencing of human gliomas and identify phenotypic differences in TAMs of distinct lineages. We isolate TAMs from patient biopsies and compare them with macrophages from non-malignant human tissue, glioma atlases, and murine glioma models. We present a novel signature that distinguishes TAMs by ontogeny in human gliomas. Blood-derived TAMs upregulate immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism compared to microglial TAMs. They are also enriched in perivascular and necrotic regions. The gene signature of blood-derived TAMs, but not microglial TAMs, correlates with significantly inferior survival in low-grade glioma. Surprisingly, TAMs frequently co-express canonical pro-inflammatory (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) genes in individual cells.

Conclusions
We conclude that blood-derived TAMs significantly infiltrate pre-treatment gliomas, to a degree that varies by glioma subtype and tumor compartment. Blood-derived TAMs do not universally conform to the phenotype of microglia, but preferentially express immunosuppressive cytokines and show an altered metabolism. Our results argue against status quo therapeutic strategies that target TAMs indiscriminately and in favor of strategies that specifically target immunosuppressive blood-derived TAMs.

Prognosis and response to therapies, including αEGFR regimens, differ dramatically by 1° site in mCRC, but pathobiologic explanations remain unclear. Methods: 198 KRAS wild-type (WT) mCRC tumors were tested for CIMP status via bisulfite pyrosequencing and PCR amplification. BRAF and NRAS were sequenced. PFS on first αEGFR regimen was retrospectively determined in 167 patients. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses with multiple imputations were performed. Tumors from 179 independent CRC patients were tested for promoter methylation (Illumina HumanMethylation450) and gene expression. Results: Inferior PFS with αEGFR therapy was associated with RC CRC (HR = 1.56, CI 1.01-2.41), CIMP-High (HR = 2.38, 1.47-3.85), BRAF MT (HR = 2.15, 1.26-3.65), and NRAS MT (HR = 2.11, 1.23-3.65). On multivariate analysis, CIMP status (p = 0.041), BRAF MT (p = 0.038), and NRAS MT (p = 0.012) remained significant, but 1° site did not (p = 0.27). Inferior OS was associated with RC CRC (HR = 1.45, 1.04-2.01), CIMP-High (HR = 1.53, 1.08-2.16), BRAF MT (HR = 2.46, 1.61-3.75), and NRAS MT (HR = 1.70, 1.03-2.81). RC 1° site was also associated with CIMP-High (OR = 2.35, 1.22-4.54) and BRAF MT (OR = 5.45, 2.47-12.03). Independent data from MDACC and TCGA showed RC 1° site and CIMP-High were both strongly associated with hypermethylation of promoters and suppression of expression of the EGFR ligands EREG and AREG. 1° site was also strongly associated with consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) 1 and 3 (p {\textless} 0.001, p = 0.03), which were previously shown in mCRC patients to have worse outcomes than the ‘classic' CMS2 subtype. Conclusions: CRC 1° site is associated with OS and PFS after αEGFR therapy. Molecular analyses suggest that BRAF MT, NRAS MT, molecular subtypes, and tumor methylation account for the effect and may provide a biologic explanation for the association with anatomic location.},

	abstract = {Characterizing the tumor immune microenvironment enables the identification of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers, the development of novel therapeutic targets and strategies, and the possibility to guide first-line treatment algorithms. Although the driving elements within the tumor microenvironment of individual primary organ sites differ, many of the salient features remain the same. The presence of a robust antitumor milieu characterized by an abundance of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, Th1 helper cells, and associated cytokines often indicates a degree of tumor containment by the immune system and can even lead to tumor elimination. Some of these features have been combined into an 'Immunoscore', which has been shown to complement the prognostic ability of the current TNM staging for early stage colorectal carcinomas. Features of the immune microenvironment are also potential therapeutic targets, and immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis are especially promising. FDA-approved indications for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 are rapidly expanding across numerous tumor types and, in certain cases, are accompanied by companion or complimentary PD-L1 immunohistochemical diagnostics. Pathologists have direct visual access to tumor tissue and in-depth knowledge of the histological variations between and within tumor types and thus are poised to drive forward our understanding of the tumor microenvironment. This review summarizes the key components of the tumor microenvironment, presents an overview of and the challenges with PD-L1 antibodies and assays, and addresses newer candidate biomarkers, such as CD8+ cell density and mutational load. Characteristics of the local immune contexture and current pathology-related practices for specific tumor types are also addressed. In the future, characterization of the host antitumor immune response using multiplexed and multimodality biomarkers may help predict which patients will respond to immune-based therapies.},

	abstract = {Purpose The prognosis of patients with colorectal cancer has sometimes proved uncertain; thus, the prognostic significance of immune criteria was compared with that of the tumor extension criteria using the American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer–TNM (AJCC/UICC-TNM) staging system.   Patients and Methods We studied the intratumoral immune infiltrates in the center of the tumor and in the invasive margin of 599 specimens of stage I to IV colorectal cancers from two independent cohorts. We analyzed these findings in relation to the degree of tumor extension and to the frequency of recurrence.   Results Growth of the primary tumor and metastatic spread were associated with decreased intratumoral immune T-cell densities. Sixty percent of patients with high densities of CD8+ cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infiltrate presented with stage Tis/T1 tumor, whereas no patients with low densities presented with such early-stage tumor. In patients who did not relapse, the density of CD8 infiltrates was inversely correlated with T stage. In contrast, in patients whose tumor recurred, the number of CD8 cells was low regardless of the T stage of the tumor. Univariate analysis showed that the immune score was significantly associated with differences in disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64, 0.60, and 0.70, respectively; P {\textless} .005). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis illustrated the predictive accuracy of the immune parameters (c-index = 65.3\%, time-dependent c-index [Cτ] = 66.5\%). A final stepwise model for Cox multivariate analysis supports the advantage of the immune score (HR, 0.64; P {\textless} .001; Cτ = 67.9\%) compared with histopathologic features in predicting recurrence as well as survival.   Conclusion Assessment of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes in combined tumor regions provides an indicator of tumor recurrence beyond that predicted by AJCC/UICC-TNM staging.},

	abstract = {Tumor-infiltrating immune cells can promote chemoresistance and metastatic spread in aggressive tumors. Consequently, the type and quality of immune responses present in the neoplastic stroma are highly predictive of patient outcome in several cancer types. In addition to host immune responses, intrinsic tumor cell activities that mimic stem cell properties have been linked to chemoresistance, metastatic dissemination, and the induction of immune suppression. Cancer stem cells are far from a static cell population; rather, their presence seems to be controlled by highly dynamic processes that are dependent on cues from the tumor stroma. However, the impact immune responses have on tumor stem cell differentiation or expansion is not well understood. In this study, we show that targeting tumor-infiltrating macrophages (TAM) and inflammatory monocytes by inhibiting either the myeloid cell receptors colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF1R) or chemokine (C–C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) decreases the number of tumor-initiating cells (TIC) in pancreatic tumors. Targeting CCR2 or CSF1R improves chemotherapeutic efficacy, inhibits metastasis, and increases antitumor T-cell responses. Tumor-educated macrophages also directly enhanced the tumor-initiating capacity of pancreatic tumor cells by activating the transcription factor STAT3, thereby facilitating macrophage-mediated suppression of CD8+ T lymphocytes. Together, our findings show how targeting TAMs can effectively overcome therapeutic resistance mediated by TICs. Cancer Res; 73(3); 1128–41. ©2012 AACR.},

	abstract = {Colorectal cancer is a major cause of mortality worldwide. Chemotherapy and radiation remain standard treatment for locally advanced disease, with current immune-targeting therapies applying to only a small subset of patients. Expression of the immuno-oncology target indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is associated with poor colorectal cancer clinical outcomes but is understudied as a potential treatment target. In this study, we examined the interaction between the IDO1 pathway and radiotherapy in colorectal cancer. We used human and mouse colorectal cancer cell lines, organoids, mouse syngeneic colorectal cancer tumor graft models, and colorectal cancer tissues from patients who received radiotherapy. IDO1 activity was blocked using the clinical IDO1 inhibitor epacadostat and by genetic disruption. We found that radiation induced IDO1 overexpression in colorectal cancer through type I and II IFN signaling. IDO1 enzymatic activity directly influenced colorectal cancer radiation sensitivity. IDO1 inhibition sensitized colorectal cancer to radiation-induced cell death, whereas the IDO1 metabolite kynurenine promoted radioprotection. IDO1 inhibition also potentiated Th1 cytokines and myeloid cell–modulating factors in the tumor microenvironment and promoted an abscopal effect on tumors outside the radiation field. Conversely, IDO1 blockade protected the normal small intestinal epithelium from radiation toxicity and accelerated recovery from radiation-induced weight loss, indicating a role in limiting side effects. These data demonstrated that IDO1 inhibition potentiates radiotherapy effectiveness in colorectal cancer. The findings also provide rationale and mechanistic insight for the study of IDO1 inhibitors as adjuvant therapy to radiation in patients with locally advanced sporadic and colitis-associated colorectal cancer.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether the tumor immune infiltrate, as recently evaluated with the Immunoscore methodology, could be a useful prognostic marker in patients with rectal cancers.
Experimental design: The influence of the immune infiltrate on patient's outcome was investigated in patients with or without preoperative chemoradiation therapy (pCRT). The density of total (CD3+) and cytotoxic (CD8+) T lymphocytes was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and quantified by a dedicated image analysis software in surgical specimens of patients with rectal cancer (n = 111) who did not receive pCRT and in tumor biopsies performed before pCRT from additional 55 patients. The results were correlated with tumor recurrence, patient's survival, and response to pCRT.
Results: The densities of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and the associated Immunoscore (from I0 to I4) were significantly correlated with differences in disease-free and overall survival (HR, 1.81 and 1.72, respectively; all P {\textless} 0.005). Cox multivariate analysis supports the advantage of the Immunoscore compared with the tumor–node–metastasis (TNM) staging in predicting recurrence and survival (all P {\textless} 0.001). Lymph node ratio added information in a prognostic model (all P {\textless} 0.05). In addition, high infiltration of CD3+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in tumor biopsies was associated with downstaging of the tumor after pCRT (CD3+ cells; Fisher exact test P = 0.01).
Conclusions: The Immunoscore could be a useful prognostic marker in patients with rectal cancer treated by primary surgery. The determination of the immune infiltrate in biopsies before treatment could be a valuable information for the prediction of response to pCRT. Clin Cancer Res; 20(7); 1891–9. ©2014 AACR.},

	abstract = {Tumors evade immune destruction by actively inducing immune tolerance through the recruitment of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Treg). We have previously described increased prevalence of these cells in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but it remains unclear what mechanisms are involved in recruiting Tregs into the tumor microenvironment. Here, we postulated that chemokines might direct Treg homing to tumor. We show, in both human pancreatic adenocarcinoma and a murine pancreatic tumor model (Pan02), that tumor cells produce increased levels of ligands for the CCR5 chemokine receptor and, reciprocally, that CD4+ Foxp3+ Tregs, compared with CD4+ Foxp3− effector T cells, preferentially express CCR5. When CCR5/CCL5 signaling is disrupted, either by reducing CCL5 production by tumor cells or by systemic administration of a CCR5 inhibitor (N,N-dimethyl-N-\{\{4-\{[2-(4-methylphenyl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-benzocyclohepten-8-yl]carbonyl\}amino\}\}benzyl]-N,N-dimethyl-N- \{\{\{4-\{\{\{[2-(4-methylphenyl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-benzocycloheptan-8-yl]carbonyl\}amino\}\}benzyl\}\}\}tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-aminiumchloride; TAK-779), Treg migration to tumors is reduced and tumors are smaller than in control mice. Thus, this study demonstrates the importance of Tregs in immune evasion by tumors, how blockade of Treg migration might inhibit tumor growth, and, specifically in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the role of CCR5 in the homing of tumor-associated Tregs. Selective targeting of CCR5/CCL5 signaling may represent a novel immunomodulatory strategy for the treatment of cancer.},

	abstract = {Immune-regulated pathways influence multiple aspects of cancer development. In this article we demonstrate that both macrophage abundance and T-cell abundance in breast cancer represent prognostic indicators for recurrence-free and overall survival. We provide evidence that response to chemotherapy is in part regulated by these leukocytes; cytotoxic therapies induce mammary epithelial cells to produce monocyte/macrophage recruitment factors, including colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) and interleukin-34, which together enhance CSF1 receptor (CSF1R)–dependent macrophage infiltration. Blockade of macrophage recruitment with CSF1R-signaling antagonists, in combination with paclitaxel, improved survival of mammary tumor–bearing mice by slowing primary tumor development and reducing pulmonary metastasis. These improved aspects of mammary carcinogenesis were accompanied by decreased vessel density and appearance of antitumor immune programs fostering tumor suppression in a CD8+ T-cell–dependent manner. These data provide a rationale for targeting macrophage recruitment/response pathways, notably CSF1R, in combination with cytotoxic therapy, and identification of a breast cancer population likely to benefit from this novel therapeutic approach.
Significance: These findings reveal that response to chemotherapy is in part regulated by the tumor immune microenvironment and that common cytotoxic drugs induce neoplastic cells to produce monocyte/macrophage recruitment factors, which in turn enhance macrophage infiltration into mammary adenocarcinomas. Blockade of pathways mediating macrophage recruitment, in combination with chemotherapy, significantly decreases primary tumor progression, reduces metastasis, and improves survival by CD8+ T-cell–dependent mechanisms, thus indicating that the immune microenvironment of tumors can be reprogrammed to instead foster antitumor immunity and improve response to cytotoxic therapy.

Here, we demonstrate the ability to interrogate ex vivo response to ICB using murine- and patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (MDOTS/PDOTS). MDOTS/PDOTS isolated from mouse and human tumors retain autologous lymphoid and myeloid cell populations and respond to ICB in short-term three-dimensional microfluidic culture. Response and resistance to ICB was recapitulated using MDOTS derived from established immunocompetent mouse tumor models. MDOTS profiling demonstrated that TBK1/IKKε inhibition enhanced response to PD-1 blockade, which effectively predicted tumor response in vivo. Systematic profiling of secreted cytokines in PDOTS captured key features associated with response and resistance to PD-1 blockade. Thus, MDOTS/PDOTS profiling represents a novel platform to evaluate ICB using established murine models as well as clinically relevant patient specimens.
Significance: Resistance to PD-1 blockade remains a challenge for many patients, and biomarkers to guide treatment are lacking. Here, we demonstrate feasibility of ex vivo profiling of PD-1 blockade to interrogate the tumor immune microenvironment, develop therapeutic combinations, and facilitate precision immuno-oncology efforts.

Indeed, several microdevices are being developed specifically for clinical use to test novel cancer therapeutics. To be effective, these platforms need to replicate the continuous interactions that exist between tumor cells and non-tumor cell elements of the tumor microenvironment through direct cell–cell or cell–matrix contact or by the secretion of signaling factors such as cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. Given the challenges of personalized or precision cancer therapy, especially with the advent of novel immunotherapies, a critical need exists for more sophisticated ex vivo diagnostic systems that recapitulate patient-specific tumor biology with the potential to predict response to immune-based therapies in real-time. Here, we present details of a method to screen for the response of patient tumors to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, first reported in Jenkins et al. Cancer Discovery, 2018, 8, 196–215, with updated evaluation of murine- and patient-derived organotypic tumor spheroids (MDOTS/PDOTS), including evaluation of the requirement for 3D microfluidic culture in MDOTS, demonstration of immune-checkpoint sensitivity of PDOTS, and expanded evaluation of tumor–immune interactions using RNA-sequencing to infer changes in the tumor–immune microenvironment. We also examine some potential improvements to current systems and discuss the challenges in translating such diagnostic assays to the clinic.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To determine the role of the CCL2/CCR2 axis and inflammatory monocytes (CCR2+/CD14+) as immunotherapeutic targets in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.
Experimental Design: Survival analysis was conducted to determine if the prevalence of preoperative blood monocytes correlates with survival in patients with pancreatic cancer following tumor resection. Inflammatory monocyte prevalence in the blood and bone marrow of patients with pancreatic cancer and controls was compared. The immunosuppressive properties of inflammatory monocytes and macrophages in the blood and tumors, respectively, of patients with pancreatic cancer were assessed. CCL2 expression by human pancreatic cancer tumors was compared with normal pancreas. A novel CCR2 inhibitor (PF-04136309) was tested in an orthotopic model of murine pancreatic cancer.
Results: Monocyte prevalence in the peripheral blood correlates inversely with survival, and low monocyte prevalence is an independent predictor of increased survival in patients with pancreatic cancer with resected tumors. Inflammatory monocytes are increased in the blood and decreased in the bone marrow of patients with pancreatic cancer compared with controls. An increased ratio of inflammatory monocytes in the blood versus the bone marrow is a novel predictor of decreased patient survival following tumor resection. Human pancreatic cancer produces CCL2, and immunosuppressive CCR2+ macrophages infiltrate these tumors. Patients with tumors that exhibit high CCL2 expression/low CD8 T-cell infiltrate have significantly decreased survival. In mice, CCR2 blockade depletes inflammatory monocytes and macrophages from the primary tumor and premetastatic liver resulting in enhanced antitumor immunity, decreased tumor growth, and reduced metastasis.
Conclusions: Inflammatory monocyte recruitment is critical to pancreatic cancer progression, and targeting CCR2 may be an effective immunotherapeutic strategy in this disease. Clin Cancer Res; 19(13); 3404–15. ©2013 AACR.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recent studies suggest that the interaction between interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6 in the microenvironment might be involved in the development and progression of human colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the expression of IL-1β/IL-6 network within the CRC microenvironment is not fully understood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The level of IL-1β/IL-6 network expression in 40 biopsies of sporadic CRC and 15 biopsies of controls was assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and double immunofluorescence staining.
RESULTS: Quantitative results obtained by real-time PCR revealed that both IL-1β and IL-6 mRNA expressions were increased in CRC tissues compared with expressions in controls. In which, IL-6 mRNA expression in primary CRC tissues showed a statistically significant relationship with tumor invasion depth. IHC observations confirmed that increased expression of IL-1β and IL-6 immunoreactivities was located in both the CRC epithelium and stroma. Furthermore, IHC results also revealed that increased expression of IL-1β receptor type 1 (IL-1R1) and IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) were observed in both CRC epithelial and stromal cells. IHCs in serial CRC sections and double immunofluorescence staining revealed a highly co-expression of IL-1R1 immunoreactivity with IL-6 immunoreactivity in the same cells, which confirmed a histological fundament of IL-1β/IL-6 network.
CONCLUSION: The IL-1β/IL-6 network is highly expressed in the CRC microenvironment, indicating that this network is important in the progression of CRC.},

	abstract = {Importance: PD-L1 (programmed cell death ligand 1) immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor mutational burden (TMB), gene expression profiling (GEP), and multiplex immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence (mIHC/IF) assays have been used to assess pretreatment tumor tissue to predict response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. However, the relative diagnostic performance of these modalities has yet to be established.
Objective: To compare studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of PD-L1 IHC, TMB, GEP, and mIHC/IF in predicting response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.
Evidence Review: A search of PubMed (from inception to June 2018) and 2013 to 2018 annual meeting abstracts from the American Association for Cancer Research, American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society for Medical Oncology, and Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer was conducted to identify studies that examined the use of PD-L1 IHC, TMB, GEP, and mIHC/IF assays to determine objective response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. For PD-L1 IHC, only clinical trials that resulted in US Food and Drug Administration approval of indications for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 were included. Studies combining more than 1 modality were also included. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guidelines were followed. Two reviewers independently extracted the clinical outcomes and test results for each individual study.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curves; their associated area under the curve (AUC); and pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LR+ and LR-) for each assay modality.
Results: Tumor specimens representing over 10 different solid tumor types in 8135 patients were assayed, and the results were correlated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 response. When each modality was evaluated with sROC curves, mIHC/IF had a significantly higher AUC (0.79) compared with PD-L1 IHC (AUC, 0.65, P {\textless} .001), GEP (AUC, 0.65, P = .003), and TMB (AUC, 0.69, P = .049). When multiple different modalities were combined such as PD-L1 IHC and/or GEP + TMB, the AUC drew nearer to that of mIHC/IF (0.74). All modalities demonstrated comparable NPV and LR-, whereas mIHC/IF demonstrated higher PPV (0.63) and LR+ (2.86) than the other approaches.
Conclusions and Relevance: In this meta-analysis, tumor mutational burden, PD-L1 IHC, and GEP demonstrated comparable AUCs in predicting response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment. Multiplex immunohistochemistry/IF and multimodality biomarker strategies appear to be associated with improved performance over PD-L1 IHC, TMB, or GEP alone. Further studies with mIHC/IF and composite approaches with a larger number of patients will be required to confirm these findings. Additional study is also required to determine the most predictive analyte combinations and to determine whether biomarker modality performance varies by tumor type.},

	abstract = {Flourescence-based multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) combined with multispectral imaging and digital image analysis (DIA) is a quantitative high-resolution method for determination of protein expression in tissue. We applied this method for five biomarkers (CDX2, SOX2, SOX9, E-cadherin, and β-catenin) using tissue microarrays of a Norwegian unselected series of primary colorectal cancer. The data were compared with previously obtained chromogenic IHC data of the same tissue cores, visually assessed by the Allred method. We found comparable results between the methods, although confirmed that DIA offered improved resolution to differentiate cases with high and low protein expression. However, we experienced inherent challenges with digital image analysis of membrane staining, which was better assessed visually. DIA and mIHC enabled quantitative analysis of biomarker coexpression on the same tissue section at the single-cell level, revealing a strong negative correlation between the differentiation markers CDX2 and SOX2. Both methods confirmed known prognostic associations for CDX2, but DIA improved data visualization and detection of clinicopathological and biological associations. In summary, mIHC combined with DIA is an efficient and reliable method to evaluate protein expression in tissue, here shown to recapitulate and improve detection of known clinicopathological and survival associations for the emerging biomarker CDX2, and is therefore a candidate approach to standardize CDX2 detection in pathology laboratories.},

Chronic inflammation is a major hallmark in colon cancer formation, but, despite the extent of local inflammatory infiltrate has been demonstrated to be extremely informative, its evaluation is not routinely assessed due to the complexity and limitations of classical immunohistochemistry (IHC). In the last years, technological advance helped in bypassing technical limits, setting up multiplex IHC (mIHC) based on tyramide signal amplification (TSA) method and designing software suited to aid pathologists in cell scoring analysis. Several studies verified the efficacy of this method, but they were restricted to the analysis of human samples. In the era of translational medicine the use of animal models to depict human pathologies, in a more complete and complex approach, is really crucial. Nevertheless, the optimization and validation of this method to species other than human is still poor. We took advantage of Multispectral Imaging System to identify the immunoprofile of Dextran Sulphate Sodium (DSS)-treated mouse colon. We optimized a protocol to sequentially stain formalin fixed paraffin embedded murine colon samples for CD3, CD8a, CD4, and CD4R5B0 antigens. With this approach we obtained a detailed lymphocyte profile, while preserving the morphological tissue context, generally lost with techniques like gene expression profiling or flow cytometry. This study, comparing the results obtained by mIHC with immunophenotyping performed with cytofluorimetric and standard IHC methods validates the potentiality and the applicability of this innovative approach.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12967-020-02336-6},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systemic inflammatory response in colorectal cancer (CRC) has been established as a prognostic factor for impaired cancer-specific survival, predominantly in patients with right-sided tumors. On the other hand, defective mismatch repair (dMMR) tumors, primarily located in the right colon, are known to have favorable survival and dense local immune infiltration. The aim of this study was to see if there is any form of relationship between these seemingly diverse entities.
METHODS: Complete clinical and long-term survival data were retrieved for 316 CRC patients operated at Helsinki University Hospital between the years 1998 and 2003. Tissue microarrays were prepared from surgical specimens and further processed and analyzed for local immune cell infiltration using multispectral imaging with a Vectra quantitative pathology imaging system and Inform software. Multiplex immunohistochemistry was applied using antibodies against CD66b, CD8, CD20, FoxP3, CD68 and pan-Cytokeratin. After exclusions, data on immune infiltration were available for 275 patients. Mismatch repair status was determined by immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: CRP was seen to be an independent predictor of cancer-specific survival but not overall survival in uni- and multivariable (HR 1.01 (1.00-1.02); p = 0.028) analyses of non-irradiated patients. There was no significant difference in CRP according to mismatch repair status, but all cases (n = 10) with CRP ≥ 75 mg/l had proficient mismatch repair (pMMR). There was a significant negative correlation between intratumor stromal infiltration by T-regulatory FOXP3+ cells and CRP (p = 0.006). There was significantly lower intratumor stromal infiltration by FOXP3+ cells (p = 0.043) in the right colon compared to the rectum, but no significant difference in CRP (p = 0.44). CRP was not a predictor of overall survival (HR 0.99, 95\% CI 0.98-1.01) nor cancer-specific survival in irradiated patients (HR 0.94, 95\% CI 0.94-1.02).
CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant negative relationship between SIR, defined as an elevated CRP, and intratumor stromal infiltration by T-regulatory FOXP3+ cells. This and the fact that all cases with a CRP {\textgreater} 75 mg/l had pMMR suggests that SIR and dMMR are independent entities in CRC. Indeed, the general lack of difference in CRP between cases with dMMR and pMMR may be evidence of overlap in cases with a less pronounced SIR.},

TGF-β signaling plays crucial and complex roles in colorectal cancer (CRC). We here aimed to investigate clinical pathological relevant of proteins involved in TGF-β signaling at CRC tissues. Multiplex fluorescent IHC was used to quantitative analysis. The levels of eight proteins (TGF-β1, TGFBRI, TGFBRII, SMAD4, SMAD2/3, p-SMAD2/3, SMAD1/5/9, and p-SMAD1/5/9) were determined in TMA sections. Quantitative analysis was carried out by a scoring system by InForm software. It revealed that TGF-β signaling was hyper active. The levels of TGF-β1, TGFBRI, TGFBRII, SMAD4, SMAD1/5/9 and p-SMAD2/3 were significantly increased in cancer tissues when compared their levels in normal tissues. Furthermore, the levels of eight proteins in stroma were significantly lower than the levels that in cancer tissues. Clinical pathological relevant analysis exhibited that TGF-β signaling inclined to suppress the progression of tumor. SMAD1/5/9, TGFBRII, SMAD2/3 were confirmed as significant predictors for overall survival. In conclusion, we established a method based on multispectral imaging to extensively explore the clinical relevant of TGF-β signaling proteins.

Conversely, select patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors respond to checkpoint blockade, necessitating novel ways to study the immune tumor microenvironment (TME). We used phenotypic and spatial data from infiltrating immune and tumor cells to model cellular mixing to predict disease specific outcomes in patients with colorectal liver metastases.
METHODS: Formalin fixed paraffin embedded metastatic colon cancer tissue from 195 patients were subjected to multiplex immunohistochemistry (mfIHC). After phenotyping, the G-function was calculated for each patient and cell type. Data was correlated with clinical outcomes and survival.
RESULTS: High tumor cell to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (TC-CTL) mixing was associated with both a pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive TME characterized by increased CTL infiltration and PD-L1+ expression, respectively. Presence and engagement of antigen presenting cells (APC) and helper T cells (Th) were associated with greater TC-CTL mixing and improved 5-year disease specific survival compared to patients with a low degree of mixing (42\% vs. 16\%, p = 0.0275). Comparison of measured mixing to a calculated theoretical random mixing revealed that PD-L1 expression on APCs resulted in an environment where CTLs were non-randomly less associated with TCs, highlighting their biologic significance.
CONCLUSION: Evaluation of immune interactions within the TME of metastatic colon cancer using mfIHC in combination with mathematical modeling characterized cellular mixing of TCs and CTLs, providing a novel strategy to better predict clinical outcomes while identifying potential candidates for immune based therapies.},

	abstract = {A prospective study explored the heterogeneous nature of metastatic melanoma using Multiplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) and flow cytometry (FACS). Multiplex IHC data quantitated immune subset number present intra-tumoral (IT) vs the tumor stroma, plus distance of immune subsets from the tumor margin (TM). In addition, mIHC showed a close association between the presence of IT CD8+ T cells and PDL1 expression in melanoma, which was more prevalent on macrophages than on melanoma cells. In contrast, FACS provided more detailed information regarding the T cell subset differentiation, their activation status and expression of immune checkpoint molecules. Interestingly, mIHC detected significantly higher Treg numbers than FACS and showed preferential CD4+ T cell distribution in the tumor stroma. Based on the mIHC and FACS data, we provide a model which defines metastatic melanoma immune context into four categories using the presence or absence of PDL1+ melanoma cells and/or macrophages, and their location within the tumor or on the periphery, combined with the presence or absence of IT CD8+ T cells. This model interprets melanoma immune context as a spectrum of tumor escape from immune control, and provides a snapshot upon which interpretation of checkpoint blockade inhibitor (CBI) therapy responses can be built.},

	abstract = {Putting immune cells on the map
Multiplexed flow cytometry allows for careful characterization of the complexity of immune cells. However, these cells do not act in isolation, and multiplexed analyses do not extend to spatial visualization of cells in tissue microenvironments. Remark et al. have combined immunohistochemistry with virtual landscaping to generate maps of immune cells in tumors stained with up to 10 distinct antibodies. Rather than using filters to resolve chromogens, they use multiple rounds of staining and destaining, followed by virtual color assignment. This simple yet powerful technique can be used to chart maps of cells in any tissue.
Despite remarkable recent achievements of immunotherapy strategies in cancer treatment, clinical responses remain limited to subsets of patients. Predictive markers of disease course and response to immunotherapy are urgently needed. Recent results have revealed the potential predictive value of immune cell phenotype and spatial distribution at the tumor site, prompting the need for multidimensional immunohistochemical analyses of tumor tissues. To address this need, we developed a sample-sparing, highly multiplexed immunohistochemistry technique based on iterative cycles of tagging, image scanning, and destaining of chromogenic substrate on a single slide. This assay, in combination with a newly developed automated digital landscaping solution, democratizes access to high-dimensional immunohistochemical analyses by capturing the complexity of the immunome using routine pathology standards. Applications of the method extend beyond cancer to screen and validate comprehensive panels of tissue-based prognostic and predictive markers, perform in-depth in situ monitoring of therapies, and identify targets of disease.
Multidimensional immunohistochemistry generates high-resolution snapshots of immune cells within a tumor.

Yet, there is a wealth of information locked up in a tissue section that is only partially accessed, due mainly to the limitations of tools and methods. Often tissues are assessed primarily based on visual analysis of one or two proteins, or 2–3 DNA or RNA molecules. Even while analysis is still based on visual perception, image analysis is starting to address the variability of human perception. This is in contrast to measuring characteristics that are substantially out of reach of human perception, such as parameters revealed through co-expression, spatial relationships, heterogeneity, and low abundance molecules. What is not routinely accessed is the information revealed through simultaneous detection of multiple markers, the spatial relationships among cells and tissue in disease, and the heterogeneity now understood to be critical to developing effective therapeutic strategies. Our purpose here is to review and assess methods for multiplexed, quantitative, image analysis based approaches, using new multicolor immunohistochemistry methods, automated multispectral slide imaging, and advanced trainable pattern recognition software. A key aspect of our approach is presenting imagery in a workflow that engages the pathologist to utilize the strengths of human perception and judgment, while significantly expanding the range of metrics collectable from tissue sections and also provide a level of consistency and precision needed to support the complexities of personalized medicine.},

Early-phase studies investigating several humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibodies targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 in advanced solid tumors paved way for the development of the first PD-1 inhibitors, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014.

The purpose of this review is to highlight the clinical development of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in cancer therapy to date. In particular, we focus on detailing the registration trials that have led to FDA-approved indications of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 therapies in cancer. As the number of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors continues to grow, predictive biomarkers, mechanisms of resistance, hyperprogressors, treatment duration and treatment beyond progression, immune-related toxicities, and clinical trial design are key concepts in need of further consideration to optimize the anticancer potential of this class of immunotherapy.},

	abstract = {We examined the immune microenvironment of primary colorectal cancer using immunohistochemistry, laser capture microdissection/qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, and functional analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. A subset of colorectal cancer displayed high infiltration with activated CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) as well as activated Th1 cells characterized by IFNγ production and the Th1 transcription factor TBET. Parallel analysis of tumor genotypes revealed that virtually all of the tumors with this active Th1/CTL microenvironment had defects in mismatch repair, as evidenced by microsatellite instability (MSI). Counterbalancing this active Th1/CTL microenvironment, MSI tumors selectively demonstrated highly upregulated expression of multiple immune checkpoints, including five—PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, LAG-3, and IDO—currently being targeted clinically with inhibitors. These findings link tumor genotype with the immune microenvironment, and explain why MSI tumors are not naturally eliminated despite a hostile Th1/CTL microenvironment. They further suggest that blockade of specific checkpoints may be selectively efficacious in the MSI subset of colorectal cancer.
Significance: The findings reported in this article are the first to demonstrate a link between a genetically defined subtype of cancer and its corresponding expression of immune checkpoints in the tumor microenvironment. The mismatch repair–defective subset of colorectal cancer selectively upregulates at least five checkpoint molecules that are targets of inhibitors currently being clinically tested.

	abstract = {Predicting responses to immunotherapy
Colon cancers with loss-of-function mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway have favorable responses to PD-1 blockade immunotherapy. In a phase 2 clinical trial, Le et al. showed that treatment success is not just limited to colon cancer (see the Perspective by Goswami and Sharma). They found that a wide range of different cancer types with MMR deficiency also responded to PD-1 blockade. The trial included some patients with pancreatic cancer, which is one of the deadliest forms of cancer. The clinical trial is still ongoing, and around 20\% of patients have so far achieved a complete response. MMR deficiency appears to be a biomarker for predicting successful treatment outcomes for several solid tumors and indicates a new therapeutic option for patients harboring MMR-deficient cancers.
Science, this issue p. 409; see also p. 358
The genomes of cancers deficient in mismatch repair contain exceptionally high numbers of somatic mutations. In a proof-of-concept study, we previously showed that colorectal cancers with mismatch repair deficiency were sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade with antibodies to programmed death receptor–1 (PD-1). We have now expanded this study to evaluate the efficacy of PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced mismatch repair–deficient cancers across 12 different tumor types. Objective radiographic responses were observed in 53\% of patients, and complete responses were achieved in 21\% of patients. Responses were durable, with median progression-free survival and overall survival still not reached. Functional analysis in a responding patient demonstrated rapid in vivo expansion of neoantigen-specific T cell clones that were reactive to mutant neopeptides found in the tumor. These data support the hypothesis that the large proportion of mutant neoantigens in mismatch repair–deficient cancers make them sensitive to immune checkpoint blockade, regardless of the cancers’ tissue of origin.
A pan-cancer biomarker is identified that can predict successful response to cancer immunotherapy in human patients.

Efficacy and safety results for the nivolumab plus ipilimumab cohort of CheckMate-142, the largest single-study report of an immunotherapy combination in dMMR/MSI-H mCRC, are reported.Patients and MethodsPatients received nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (four doses) followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks. Primary end point was investigator-assessed ORR.ResultsOf 119 patients, 76\% had received ≥ two prior systemic therapies. At median follow-up of 13.4 months, investigator-assessed ORR was 55\% (95\% CI, 45.2 to 63.8), and disease control rate for ≥ 12 weeks was 80\%. Median duration of response was not reached; most responses (94\%) were ongoing at data cutoff. Progression-free survival rates were 76\% (9 months) and 71\% (12 months); respective OS rates were 87\% and 85\%. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements were observed in patient-reported outcomes, including functioning, symptoms, and quality of life. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 32\% of patients and were manageable. Patients (13\%) who discontinued treatment because of study drug-related AEs had an ORR (63\%) consistent with that of the overall population.ConclusionNivolumab plus ipilimumab demonstrated high response rates, encouraging progression-free survival and OS at 12 months, manageable safety, and meaningful improvements in key patient-reported outcomes. Indirect comparisons suggest combination therapy provides improved efficacy relative to anti–programmed death-1 monotherapy and has a favorable benefit-risk profile.

	abstract = {Background
Elucidation of immune populations with single-cell RNA-seq has greatly benefited the field of immunology by deepening the characterization of immune heterogeneity and leading to the discovery of new subtypes. However, single-cell methods inherently suffer from limitations in the recovery of complete transcriptomes due to the prevalence of cellular and transcriptional dropout events. This issue is often compounded by limited sample availability and limited prior knowledge of heterogeneity, which can confound data interpretation.

Results
Here, we systematically benchmarked seven high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods. We prepared 21 libraries under identical conditions of a defined mixture of two human and two murine lymphocyte cell lines, simulating heterogeneity across immune-cell types and cell sizes. We evaluated methods by their cell recovery rate, library efficiency, sensitivity, and ability to recover expression signatures for each cell type. We observed higher mRNA detection sensitivity with the 10x Genomics 5′ v1 and 3′ v3 methods. We demonstrate that these methods have fewer dropout events, which facilitates the identification of differentially-expressed genes and improves the concordance of single-cell profiles to immune bulk RNA-seq signatures.

Conclusion
Overall, our characterization of immune cell mixtures provides useful metrics, which can guide selection of a high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq method for profiling more complex immune-cell heterogeneity usually found in vivo.

	abstract = {Background
Elucidation of immune populations with single-cell RNA-seq has greatly benefited the field of immunology by deepening the characterization of immune heterogeneity and leading to the discovery of new subtypes. However, single-cell methods inherently suffer from limitations in the recovery of complete transcriptomes due to the prevalence of cellular and transcriptional dropout events. This issue is often compounded by limited sample availability and limited prior knowledge of heterogeneity, which can confound data interpretation.

Results
Here, we systematically benchmarked seven high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods. We prepared 21 libraries under identical conditions of a defined mixture of two human and two murine lymphocyte cell lines, simulating heterogeneity across immune-cell types and cell sizes. We evaluated methods by their cell recovery rate, library efficiency, sensitivity, and ability to recover expression signatures for each cell type. We observed higher mRNA detection sensitivity with the 10x Genomics 5′ v1 and 3′ v3 methods. We demonstrate that these methods have fewer dropout events, which facilitates the identification of differentially-expressed genes and improves the concordance of single-cell profiles to immune bulk RNA-seq signatures.

Conclusion
Overall, our characterization of immune cell mixtures provides useful metrics, which can guide selection of a high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq method for profiling more complex immune-cell heterogeneity usually found in vivo.

Utilizing a barcoding method that allows a simultaneous single cell analysis of the tumor, non-involved lung and blood cells together with multiplex tissue imaging to assess spatial cell distribution, we provide a detailed immune cell atlas of early lung tumors. We show that stage I lung adenocarcinoma lesions already harbor significantly altered T cell and NK cell compartments. Moreover, we identified changes in tumor infiltrating myeloid cell (TIM) subsets that likely compromise anti-tumor T cell immunity. Paired single cell analyses thus offer valuable knowledge of tumor-driven immune changes, providing a powerful tool for the rational design of immune therapies.,

	abstract = {T cells are key elements of cancer immunotherapy1 but certain fundamental properties, such as the development and migration of T cells within tumours, remain unknown. The enormous T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, which is required for the recognition of foreign and self-antigens2, could serve as lineage tags to track these T cells in tumours3. Here we obtained transcriptomes of 11,138 single T cells from 12 patients with colorectal cancer, and developed single T cell analysis by RNA sequencing and TCR tracking (STARTRAC) indices to quantitatively analyse the dynamic relationships among 20 identified T cell subsets with distinct functions and clonalities. Although both CD8+ effector and ‘exhausted’ T cells exhibited high clonal expansion, they were independently connected with tumour-resident CD8+ effector memory cells, implicating a TCR-based fate decision. Of the CD4+ T cells, most tumour-infiltrating T regulatory (Treg) cells showed clonal exclusivity, whereas certain Treg cell clones were developmentally linked to several T helper (TH) cell clones. Notably, we identified two IFNG+ TH1-like cell clusters in tumours that were associated with distinct IFNγ-regulating transcription factors —the GZMK+ effector memory T cells, which were associated with EOMES and RUNX3, and CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cell clusters, which were associated with BHLHE40. Only CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cells were preferentially enriched in patients with microsatellite-instable tumours, and this might explain their favourable responses to immune-checkpoint blockade. Furthermore, IGFLR1 was highly expressed in both CXCL13+BHLHE40+ TH1-like cells and CD8+ exhausted T cells and possessed co-stimulatory functions. Our integrated STARTRAC analyses provide a powerful approach to dissect the T cell properties in colorectal cancer comprehensively, and could provide insights into the dynamic relationships of T cells in other cancers.},

	abstract = {Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment and rejuvenated the field of tumor immunology. Several types of immunotherapy, including adoptive cell transfer (ACT) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have obtained durable clinical responses, but their efficacies vary, and only subsets of cancer patients can benefit from them. Immune infiltrates in the tumor microenvironment (TME) have been shown to play a key role in tumor development and will affect the clinical outcomes of cancer patients. Comprehensive profiling of tumor-infiltrating immune cells would shed light on the mechanisms of cancer–immune evasion, thus providing opportunities for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. However, the highly heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the TME impedes the precise dissection of intratumoral immune cells. With recent advances in single-cell technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and mass cytometry, systematic interrogation of the TME is feasible and will provide insights into the functional diversities of tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In this review, we outline the recent progress in cancer immunotherapy, particularly by focusing on landmark studies and the recent single-cell characterization of tumor-associated immune cells, and we summarize the phenotypic diversities of intratumoral immune cells and their connections with cancer immunotherapy. We believe such a review could strengthen our understanding of the progress in cancer immunotherapy, facilitate the elucidation of immune cell modulation in tumor progression, and thus guide the development of novel immunotherapies for cancer treatment.},

We integrate RNA-seq, DNA sequencing, TCR-seq and SNP array data across multiple regions of liver cancer specimens to map spatio-temporal interactions between cancer and immune cells.

Regional expression of passenger mutations dominantly recruits adaptive responses as opposed to hepatitis B virus and cancer-testis antigens. We detect different clonal expansion of the adaptive immune system in distant regions of the same tumor. An ITH-based gene signature improves single-biopsy patient survival predictions and an expression survey of 38,553 single cells across 7 regions of 2 patients further reveals heterogeneity in liver cancer. These data quantify transcriptomic ITH and how the different components of the HCC ecosystem interact during cancer evolution., Immune-mediated selection pressures impact the clonal evolution of tumours.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is a highly heterogeneous disease. RNA profiles of bulk tumors have enabled transcriptional classification of CRC. However, such ways of sequencing can only target a cell colony and obscure the signatures of distinct cell populations. Alternatively, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), which can provide unbiased analysis of all cell types, opens the possibility to map cellular heterogeneity of CRC unbiasedly.
METHODS: In this study, we utilized scRNA-seq to profile cells from cancer tissue of a CRC patient. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses were performed to understand the roles of genes within the clusters.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The 2824 cells were analyzed and categorized into 5 distinct clusters by scRNA-seq. For every cluster, specific cell markers can be applied, indicating each 1 of them different from another. We discovered that the tumor of CRC displayed a clear sign of heterogenicity, while genes within each cluster serve different functions. GO term analysis also stated that different cluster's relatedness towards the tumor of CRC differs. Three clusters participate in peripheral works in cells, including, energy transport, extracellular matrix generation, etc; Genes in other 2 clusters participate more in immunology processes. Lastly, trajectory plot analysis also supports the viewpoint, in that some clusters present in different states and pseudo-time, while others present in a single state or pseudo time. Our analysis provides more insight into the heterogeneity of CRC, which can provide assistance to further researches on this topic.},

We sought to identify differences in cellular composition between normal colon and colorectal cancer, and to define signals controlling cancer cell development.We used single cell RNA and protein profiling to analyze tumors and matched normal tissues of twelve colorectal cancer patients. RNA metabolic labelling followed by single cell RNA sequencing in patient-derived normal colon and colorectal cancer organoids was employed to define colorectal cancer cell developmental trajectories.We find that colorectal cancer tissues exhibited consistent changes in cellular composition in the epithelial, immune and stromal compartments across patients compared to normal colon. Tumor epithelial cells displayed patient-specific gene expression often correlating with somatic copy number alterations, but mainly organized into patient-overarching clusters. These clusters were defined by cell type-specific transcriptional programs related to stem, transient-amplifying and immature goblet cells, and showed differential expression for signatures of oncogenic traits such as replication stress. Patient-derived colorectal cancer organoids exhibited developmental trajectories forming along a gradient of mitogen-activated protein kinase activity that were Wnt-independent. Likewise, colorectal cancer cell types of patient samples were organized by mitogen-activated protein kinase activity.Our single-cell analyses provide a subtyping system for colorectal cancer cells based on transcriptional readout of morphogenetic signals and oncogenic traits. We provide evidence that mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling, a key pathway for targeted therapy, is a main driver of colorectal cancer cell plasticity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {Background The clinical benefit of immunotherapeutic approaches against cancer has been well established although complete responses are only observed in a minority of patients. Combination immunotherapy offers an attractive avenue to develop more effective cancer therapies by improving the efficacy and duration of the tumor-specific T-cell response. Here, we aimed at deciphering the mechanisms governing the response to PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade to support the rational design of combination immunotherapy.
Methods Mice bearing subcutaneous MC-38 tumors were treated with blocking PD-L1 antibodies. To establish high-dimensional immune signatures of immunotherapy-specific responses, the tumor microenvironment was analyzed by CyTOF mass cytometry using 38 cellular markers. Findings were further examined and validated by flow cytometry and by functional in vivo experiments. Immune profiling was extended to the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer patients.
Results PD-L1 blockade induced selectively the expansion of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets, co-expressing both activating (ICOS) and inhibitory (LAG-3, PD-1) molecules. By therapeutically co-targeting these molecules on the TAI cell subsets in vivo by agonistic and antagonist antibodies, we were able to enhance PD-L1 blockade therapy as evidenced by an increased number of TAI cells within the tumor micro-environment and improved tumor protection. Moreover, TAI cells were also found in the tumor-microenvironment of colorectal cancer patients.
Conclusions This study shows the presence of T cell subsets in the tumor micro-environment expressing both activating and inhibitory receptors. These TAI cells can be targeted by combined immunotherapy leading to improved survival.},

Colonic mucosa samples from patients with UC were characterized by expansion of IL17A+ CD161+ effector memory T cells and IL17A+ T-regulatory cells; expansion of HLA-DR+CD56+ granulocytes; and reductions in type 3 innate lymphoid cells. Mucosal samples from patients with active CD were characterized by IL1B+HLA-DR+CD38+ T cells, IL1B+TNF+IFNG$^{\textrm{+}}$ naïve B cells, IL1B+ dendritic cells (DCs), and IL1B+ plasmacytoid DCs. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with active CD differed from those of active UC in that the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with CD had increased IL1B+ T-regulatory cells, IL1B+ DCs and IL1B+ plasmacytoid DCs, IL1B+ monocytes, and fewer group 1 innate lymphoid cells.

The tumor-stroma ratio (TSR) is a strong independent prognostic factor in colorectal cancer and is easily assessed using conventional hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained paraffin sections at the invasive margin of the tumor. We aim to understand the biology of the tumor stroma in colorectal cancer by investigating the transcriptomic profiles of tumors classified by the TSR method. The TSR was assessed in a cohort of 71 colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery without (neo)adjuvant therapy. In the cohort, stroma-high tumors were distinguished from stroma-low tumors at gene expression level in the upregulation of biological pathways related to extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and myogenesis. The activated microenvironment in stroma-high tumors overexpressed different types of collagen genes, THBS2 and 4 as well as INHBA, COX71A and LGALS1/galectin-1. The upregulation of THBS2, COX7A1 and LGALS1/galectin-1. The upregulation of THBS2, COX7A1 and LGALS1/galectin-1 in stroma-high tumors was validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas. In conclusion, the gene expression data reflects the high stromal content of tumors assessed based on the histological method, the TSR. The composition of the microenvironment suggests an altered proteolysis resulting in ECM remodeling and invasive capacity of tumor cells.},

	abstract = {Background
Solid tumour growth is the consequence of a complex interplay between cancer cells and their microenvironment. Recently, a new global transcriptomic immune classification of solid tumours has identified six immune subtypes (ISs) (C1–C6). Our aim was to specifically characterise ISs in colorectal cancer (CRC) and assess their interplay with the consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs).
Methods
Clinical and molecular information, including CMSs and ISs, were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (N = 625). Immune cell populations, differential gene expression and gene set enrichment analysis were performed to characterise ISs in the global CRC population by using CMSs.
Results
Only 5 ISs were identified in CRC, predominantly C1 wound healing (77\%) and C2 IFN-γ dominant (17\%). CMS1 showed the highest proportion of C2 (53\%), whereas C1 was particularly dominant in CMS2 (91\%). CMS3 had the highest representation of C3 inflammatory (7\%) and C4 lymphocyte depleted ISs (4\%), whereas all C6 TGF-β dominant cases belonged to CMS4 (2.3\%). Prognostic relevance of ISs in CRC substantially differed from that reported for the global TCGA, and ISs had a greater ability to stratify the prognosis of CRC patients than CMS classification. C2 had higher densities of CD8, CD4 activated, follicular helper T cells, regulatory T cells and neutrophils and the highest M1/M2 polarisation. C2 had a heightened activation of pathways related to the immune system, apoptosis and DNA repair, mTOR signalling and oxidative phosphorylation, whereas C1 was more dependent of metabolic pathways.
Conclusions
The correlation of IS and CMS allows a more precise categorisation of patients with relevant clinical and biological implications, which may be valuable tools to improve tailored therapeutic interventions in CRC patients.},

However, such investigations on large-scale public data remain challenging. To lower the barriers for the analysis of complex tumor–immune interactions, we significantly improved our previous web platform TIMER. Instead of just using one algorithm, TIMER2.0 (http://timer.cistrome.org/) provides more robust estimation of immune infiltration levels for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or user-provided tumor profiles using six state-of-the-art algorithms. TIMER2.0 provides four modules for investigating the associations between immune infiltrates and genetic or clinical features, and four modules for exploring cancer-related associations in the TCGA cohorts. Each module can generate a functional heatmap table, enabling the user to easily identify significant associations in multiple cancer types simultaneously.

	abstract = {The cellular adaptive immune system mounts a response to many solid tumours mediated by tumour-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs). Basic measurements of these TILs, including total count, show promise as prognostic markers for a variety of cancers, including ovarian and colorectal. In addition, recent therapeutic advances are thought to exploit this immune response to effectively fight melanoma, with promising studies showing efficacy in additional cancers. However, many of the basic properties of TILs are poorly understood, including specificity, clonality, and spatial heterogeneity of the T-cell response. We utilize deep sequencing of rearranged T-cell receptor beta (TCRB) genes to characterize the basic properties of TILs in ovarian carcinoma. Due to somatic rearrangement during T-cell development, the TCR beta chain sequence serves as a molecular tag for each T-cell clone. Using these sequence tags, we assess similarities and differences between infiltrating T cells in discretely sampled sections of large tumours and compare to T cells from peripheral blood. Within the limits of sensitivity of our assay, the TIL repertoires show strong similarity throughout each tumour and are distinct from the circulating T-cell repertoire. We conclude that the cellular adaptive immune response within ovarian carcinomas is spatially homogeneous and distinct from the T-cell compartment of peripheral blood.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Rectal cancer remains a challenging disease to treat. Therapy for locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC), the most frequent presentation, has evolved to include a multimodal approach of radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. While this approach improves local disease control, the distant recurrence rate is nearly 30\% and treatment-related morbidity is substantial, thus underscoring the need for new therapeutic approaches with better efficacy and lower side effects. Immunotherapy could potentially fill this need, but its promise is not yet realized in rectal cancer. In this translational science review, we address what is known about how cytotoxic therapies shape rectal cancer immunity and potentially prime the tumor microenvironment for response to immune checkpoint inhibitors and other immunotherapies. We also address the role of current immunotherapies in colorectal cancer and highlight where novel immunotherapy approaches are currently being evaluated in LARC. Finally, we address important future directions in LARC immunotherapy including the need to define optimal therapeutic sequencing, predictive biomarkers, strategies to limit treatment-related side effects and the potential of gut microbiome manipulation to improve outcomes. In summary, this review provides a framework to guide future research and inform immunotherapy trial design so as to advance rectal cancer care.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we present Abseq, a method to detect and quantitate proteins in single cells at ultrahigh throughput. Like flow and mass cytometry, Abseq uses specific antibodies to detect epitopes of interest; however, unlike these methods, antibodies are labeled with sequence tags that can be read out with microfluidic barcoding and DNA sequencing. We demonstrate this novel approach by characterizing surface proteins of different cell types at the single-cell level and distinguishing between the cells by their protein expression profiles. DNA-tagged antibodies provide multiple advantages for profiling proteins in single cells, including the ability to amplify low-abundance tags to make them detectable with sequencing, to use molecular indices for quantitative results, and essentially limitless multiplexing.},

	abstract = {Background
A pronounced tumour inflammatory infiltrate is known to confer a good outcome in colorectal cancer. Klintrup and colleagues reported a structured assessment of the inflammatory reaction at the invasive margin scoring low grade or high grade. The aim of the present study was to examine the prognostic value of tumour inflammatory infiltrate in node-negative colorectal cancer.
Methods
Two hundred patients had undergone surgery for node-negative colorectal cancer between 1997 and 2004. Specimens were scored with Jass’ and Klintrup’s criteria for peritumoural infiltrate. Pathological data were taken from the reports at that time.
Results
Low-grade inflammatory infiltrate assessed using Klintrup’s criteria was an independent prognostic factor in node-negative disease. In patients with a low-risk Petersen Index (n=179), low-grade infiltrate carried a threefold increased risk of cancer death. Low-grade infiltrate was related to increasing T stage and an infiltrating margin.
Conclusion
Assessment of inflammatory infiltrate using Klintrup’s criteria provides independent prognostic information on node-negative colorectal cancer. A high-grade local inflammatory response may represent effective host immune responses impeding tumour growth.},

These datasets have furthered our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and its underlying mechanisms in homogeneous populations. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data clustering can group cells belonging to the same cell type based on patterns embedded in gene expression. However, scRNA-seq data are high-dimensional, noisy, and sparse, owing to the limitation of existing scRNA-seq technologies. Traditional clustering methods are not effective and efficient for high-dimensional and sparse matrix computations. Therefore, several dimension reduction methods have been introduced. To validate a reliable and standard research routine, we conducted a comprehensive review and evaluation of four classical dimension reduction methods and five clustering models. Four experiments were progressively performed on two large scRNA-seq datasets using 20 models. Results showed that the feature selection method contributed positively to high-dimensional and sparse scRNA-seq data. Moreover, feature-extraction methods were able to promote clustering performance, although this was not eternally immutable. Independent component analysis (ICA) performed well in those small compressed feature spaces, whereas principal component analysis was steadier than all the other feature-extraction methods. In addition, ICA was not ideal for fuzzy C-means clustering in scRNA-seq data analysis. K-means clustering was combined with feature-extraction methods to achieve good results.},

The spatial and temporal variations of mRNAs, as well as the local availability of resources for protein biosynthesis, strongly influence the relationship between protein levels and their coding transcripts. We further discuss the buffering of mRNA fluctuations at the level of protein concentrations.

An outstanding question is to what extent this heterogeneity is similar between cancers affecting different organs. Here, we profile 233,591 single cells from patients with lung, colorectal, ovary and breast cancer (n = 36) and construct a pan-cancer blueprint of stromal cell heterogeneity using different single-cell RNA and protein-based technologies. We identify 68 stromal cell populations, of which 46 are shared between cancer types and 22 are unique. We also characterise each population phenotypically by highlighting its marker genes, transcription factors, metabolic activities and tissue-specific expression differences. Resident cell types are characterised by substantial tissue specificity, while tumor-infiltrating cell types are largely shared across cancer types. Finally, by applying the blueprint to melanoma tumors treated with checkpoint immunotherapy and identifying a naïve CD4+ T-cell phenotype predictive of response to checkpoint immunotherapy, we illustrate how it can serve as a guide to interpret scRNA-seq data. In conclusion, by providing a comprehensive blueprint through an interactive web server, we generate the first panoramic view on the shared complexity of stromal cells in different cancers.},

This revealed a large and diverse myeloid compartment, with dendritic cell and macrophage populations that were conserved across species and dynamic across disease stages. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) consisted of microglia- or monocyte-derived populations, with both exhibiting additional heterogeneity, including subsets with conserved lipid and hypoxic signatures. Microglia- and monocyte-derived TAMs were self-renewing populations that competed for space and could be depleted via CSF1R blockade. Microglia-derived TAMs were predominant in newly diagnosed tumors, but were outnumbered by monocyte-derived TAMs following recurrence, especially in hypoxic tumor environments.

To elucidate underlying mechanisms, we developed Perturb-CITE-sequencing (Perturb-CITE-seq), enabling pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)–Cas9 perturbations with single-cell transcriptome and protein readouts. In patient-derived melanoma cells and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) co-cultures, we profiled transcriptomes and 20 proteins in {\textasciitilde}218,000 cells under {\textasciitilde}750 perturbations associated with cancer cell-intrinsic ICI resistance (ICR). We recover known mechanisms of resistance, including defects in the interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–JAK/STAT and antigen-presentation pathways in RNA, protein and perturbation space, and new ones, including loss/downregulation of CD58. Loss of CD58 conferred immune evasion in multiple co-culture models and was downregulated in tumors of melanoma patients with ICR. CD58 protein expression was not induced by IFN-γ signaling, and CD58 loss conferred immune evasion without compromising major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, suggesting that it acts orthogonally to known mechanisms of ICR. This work provides a framework for the deciphering of complex mechanisms by large-scale perturbation screens with multimodal, single-cell readouts, and discovers potentially clinically relevant mechanisms of immune evasion.},

We also develop a computational framework, mixscape, that substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio in single-cell perturbation screens by identifying and removing confounding sources of variation. Applying these tools, we identify and validate regulators of PD-L1 and leverage our multimodal data to identify both transcriptional and post-transcriptional modes of regulation. Specifically, we discover that the Kelch-like protein KEAP1 and the transcriptional activator NRF2 mediate the upregulation of PD-L1 after interferon (IFN)-γ stimulation.

Our comprehensive analysis revealed two phenotypically distinct cytotoxic T cell populations within tumors. Its main population transitioned from one positively prognostic effector memory to the other non-prognostic resident memory population in a stage-dependent manner. We further defined several Treg subpopulations within tumors. While Tregs overall were associated with positive clinical outcomes, the CD38+ peripherally-derived Treg subpopulation, phenotypically related to Th17 cells, correlated with poor outcomes independent of cancer stage. Thus, we demonstrated the prognostic significance of single CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell infiltrates in CRC, which could inform therapeutic strategies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

            The recent rapid spread of single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) methods has created a large variety of experimental and computational pipelines for which best practices have not yet been established. Here, we use simulations based on five scRNA-seq library protocols in combination with nine realistic differential expression (DE) setups to systematically evaluate three mapping, four imputation, seven normalisation and four differential expression testing approaches resulting in {\textasciitilde}3000 pipelines, allowing us to also assess interactions among pipeline steps. We find that choices of normalisation and library preparation protocols have the biggest impact on scRNA-seq analyses. Specifically, we find that library preparation determines the ability to detect symmetric expression differences, while normalisation dominates pipeline performance in asymmetric DE-setups. Finally, we illustrate the importance of informed choices by showing that a good scRNA-seq pipeline can have the same impact on detecting a biological signal as quadrupling the sample size.},

	abstract = {Enabling precision medicine requires developing robust patient stratification methods as well as drugs tailored to homogeneous subgroups of patients from a heterogeneous population. Developing de novo drugs is expensive and time consuming with an ultimately low FDA approval rate. These limitations make developing new drugs for a small portion of a disease population unfeasible. Therefore, drug repositioning is an essential alternative for developing new drugs for a disease subpopulation. This shows the importance of developing data-driven approaches that find druggable homogeneous subgroups within the disease population and reposition the drugs for these subgroups. In this study, we developed an explainable AI approach for patient stratification and drug repositioning. Contrast pattern mining and network analysis were used to discover homogeneous subgroups within a disease population. For each subgroup, a biomedical network analysis was done to find the drugs that are most relevant to a given subgroup of patients. The set of candidate drugs for each subgroup was ranked using an aggregated drug score assigned to each drug. The proposed method represents a human-in-the-loop framework, where medical experts use the data-driven results to generate hypotheses and obtain insights into potential therapeutic candidates for patients who belong to a subgroup. Colorectal cancer (CRC) was used as a case study. Patients' phenotypic and genotypic data was utilized with a heterogeneous knowledge base because it gives a multi-view perspective for finding new indications for drugs outside of their original use. Our analysis of the top candidate drugs for the subgroups identified by medical experts showed that most of these drugs are cancer-related, and most of them have the potential to be a CRC regimen based on studies in the literature.},

	abstract = {Background
De novo inference of clinically relevant gene function relationships from tumor RNA-seq remains a challenging task. Current methods typically either partition patient samples into a few subtypes or rely upon analysis of pairwise gene correlations that will miss some groups in noisy data. Leveraging higher dimensional information can be expected to increase the power to discern targetable pathways, but this is commonly thought to be an intractable computational problem.

Methods
In this work we adapt a recently developed machine learning algorithm for sensitive detection of complex gene relationships. The algorithm, CorEx, efficiently optimizes over multivariate mutual information and can be iteratively applied to generate a hierarchy of relatively independent latent factors. The learned latent factors are used to stratify patients for survival analysis with respect to both single factors and combinations. These analyses are performed and interpreted in the context of biological function annotations and protein network interactions that might be utilized to match patients to multiple therapies.

Results
Analysis of ovarian tumor RNA-seq samples demonstrates the algorithm’s power to infer well over one hundred biologically interpretable gene cohorts, several times more than standard methods such as hierarchical clustering and k-means. The CorEx factor hierarchy is also informative, with related but distinct gene clusters grouped by upper nodes. Some latent factors correlate with patient survival, including one for a pathway connected with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer that is regulated by a microRNA that modulates epigenetics. Further, combinations of factors lead to a synergistic survival advantage in some cases.

Conclusions
In contrast to studies that attempt to partition patients into a small number of subtypes (typically 4 or fewer) for treatment purposes, our approach utilizes subgroup information for combinatoric transcriptional phenotyping. Considering only the 66 gene expression groups that are found to both have significant Gene Ontology enrichment and are small enough to indicate specific drug targets implies a computational phenotype for ovarian cancer that allows for 366 possible patient profiles, enabling truly personalized treatment. The findings here demonstrate a new technique that sheds light on the complexity of gene expression dependencies in tumors and could eventually enable the use of patient RNA-seq profiles for selection of personalized and effective cancer treatments.

	abstract = {Understanding global communications among cells requires accurate representation of cell-cell signaling links and effective systems-level analyses of those links. We construct a database of interactions among ligands, receptors and their cofactors that accurately represent known heteromeric molecular complexes. We then develop CellChat, a tool that is able to quantitatively infer and analyze intercellular communication networks from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data. CellChat predicts major signaling inputs and outputs for cells and how those cells and signals coordinate for functions using network analysis and pattern recognition approaches. Through manifold learning and quantitative contrasts, CellChat classifies signaling pathways and delineates conserved and context-specific pathways across different datasets. Applying CellChat to mouse and human skin datasets shows its ability to extract complex signaling patterns. Our versatile and easy-to-use toolkit CellChat and a web-based Explorer (http://www.cellchat.org/) will help discover novel intercellular communications and build cell-cell communication atlases in diverse tissues.},

	abstract = {Cell–cell communication mediated by ligand–receptor complexes is critical to coordinating diverse biological processes, such as development, differentiation and inflammation. To investigate how the context-dependent crosstalk of different cell types enables physiological processes to proceed, we developed CellPhoneDB, a novel repository of ligands, receptors and their interactions. In contrast to other repositories, our database takes into account the subunit architecture of both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. We integrated our resource with a statistical framework that predicts enriched cellular interactions between two cell types from single-cell transcriptomics data. Here, we outline the structure and content of our repository, provide procedures for inferring cell–cell communication networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data and present a practical step-by-step guide to help implement the protocol. CellPhoneDB v.2.0 is an updated version of our resource that incorporates additional functionalities to enable users to introduce new interacting molecules and reduces the time and resources needed to interrogate large datasets. CellPhoneDB v.2.0 is publicly available, both as code and as a user-friendly web interface; it can be used by both experts and researchers with little experience in computational genomics. In our protocol, we demonstrate how to evaluate meaningful biological interactions with CellPhoneDB v.2.0 using published datasets. This protocol typically takes {\textasciitilde}2 h to complete, from installation to statistical analysis and visualization, for a dataset of {\textasciitilde}10 GB, 10,000 cells and 19 cell types, and using five threads.},

	abstract = {Purpose: CD44 is of functional importance for tumor initiation and progression in colorectal cancer, but how this molecule benefits cancer cells from the tumor microenvironment, especially tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), remains poorly defined.Experimental Design:In vivo tumorigenic assays were conducted to assess the role of murine TAMs in the tumorigenesis of human colorectal cancer cells. Both in vitro and in vivo osteopontin (OPN) expression levels in TAMs were examined by immunohistochemistry, quantitative PCR, and Western blotting. Soft agar colony formation assays were used to estimate the clonogenicity of colorectal cancer cells that had received different treatments. The relationships between the expression levels of OPN, CD44v6, and CD68 and clinical prognosis were evaluated by tissue microarray analysis.Results: We found that macrophages, when coinjected or cocultured with CD44-positive colorectal cancer cells, were able to produce higher levels of OPN, which in turn facilitated the tumorigenicity and clonogenicity of the colorectal cancer cells. The knockdown of CD44 or treatment with blocking antibodies to CD44 attenuated OPN secretion. OPN, through binding to its receptor CD44, activated c-jun-NH2-kinase signaling and promoted the clonogenicity of colorectal cancer cells. Moreover, tissue microarray data have shown that OPN expression, in combination with CD44v6, has a negative correlation with colorectal cancer patient survival.Conclusions: These results suggest that the OPN–CD44 interaction is important for colorectal cancer progression and could serve as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colorectal cancer.

	title = {Osteopontin and colon cancer progression},
	abstract = {Human colon cancer affects nearly 150,000 patients and results in 60,000 deaths in the United States per year. Despite signiﬁcant advances in the management of the colon cancer patient, little change in survival rates has been appreciated over the past 50 years. The primary cause of death relates to the development of distant metastases to organs such as the liver and lungs. Colon cancer represents an important disease to study in order to better understand tumor progression and metastasis primarily because there is almost a stepwise advancement of the disease that is marked by measurable genetic and associated phenotypic alterations. Metastasis appears to be the end product of the development of ‘Herculean’ cell clones capable of independent growth, invasion, adhesion, avoidance of apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Although signiﬁcant progress has been made in understanding the sequential genetic events leading to the development of cancer, the precise genes and the associated molecular pathways underlying the development of metastatic potential are still poorly understood. Moreover, our enhanced genetic knowledge has had relatively little trickle down effect on our clinical management of this deadly disease. For this reason, we undertook a comprehensive study to develop a molecular encyclopedia of new tumor markers and markers of tumor progression, some of which will hopefully prove useful in the clinical management of colon cancer patients by means of their capacity to detect and predict the stage and disease burden. This review will focus on the application of gene expression proﬁling technology to the problem of identifying new tumor markers and progression markers, and the discovery of osteopontin as the leading candidate clinical marker derived from a screen of approximately 12,000 named genes.},

	abstract = {OPN is a multifunctional phosphoglycoprotein expressed in a wide range of cells, including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, neurons, epithelial cells, T, B, NK, NK T, myeloid, and innate lymphoid cells. OPN plays an important role in diverse biological processes and is implicated in multiple diseases such as cardiovascular, diabetes, kidney, proinflammatory, fibrosis, nephrolithiasis, wound healing, and cancer. In cancer patients, overexpressed OPN is often detected in the tumor microenvironment and elevated serum OPN level is correlated with poor prognosis. Initially identified in activated T cells and termed as early T cell activation gene, OPN links innate cells to adaptive cells in immune response to infection and cancer. Recent single cell RNA sequencing revealed that OPN is primarily expressed in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in human cancer patients. Emerging experimental data reveal a key role of OPN is tumor immune evasion through regulating macrophage polarization, recruitment, and inhibition of T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, in addition to its well-established direct tumor cell promotion function, OPN also acts as an immune checkpoint to negatively regulate T cell activation. The OPN protein level is highly elevated in peripheral blood of human cancer patients. OPN blockade immunotherapy with OPN neutralization monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) thus represents an attractive approach in human cancer immunotherapy.},

OPN overexpression also induced PI3K signalling, expression of Snail and Matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9), and suppressed the expression of E-cadherin in KRAS mutant cells. In human CRC specimens, a high-level expression of OPN significantly predicted poorer survival in CRC patients and OPN expression was positively correlated with MMP9 expression, and negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, we have found that 15 genes were co-upregulated in OPN highly expression CRC and a list of candidate drugs that may have potential to reverse the secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) gene signature by connectivity mapping.

	abstract = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have multifaceted roles in tumor development, particularly linked with tumor angiogenesis and invasion, but the molecular mechanism underlying this association remains unclear. In this study, we report that lack of osteopontin (OPN) suppresses melanoma growth in opn−/− mice and macrophages are the crucial component responsible for OPN-regulated melanoma growth. In tumor microenvironment, OPN activates macrophages and influences angiogenesis by enhancing cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)-dependent prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production in an autocrine manner. Furthermore, we identify α9β1 integrin as a functional receptor for OPN that mediates its effect and activates ERK and p38 signaling, which ultimately leads to COX-2 expression in macrophages. The major role played by OPN and PGE2 in angiogenesis are further amplified by upregulation of MMP-9. OPN-activated macrophages promote the migration of endothelial and cancer cells via PGE2. These findings provide evidence that TAMs serve as source of key components such as OPN and COX-2-derived PGE2 and MMP-9 in melanoma microenvironment. Clinical specimens analyses revealed that increased infiltration of OPN-positive TAMs correlate with melanoma growth and angiogenesis. These data provide compelling evidence that OPN and COX-2 expressing macrophages are obligatory factors in melanoma growth. We conclude that OPN signaling is involved in macrophage recruitment into tumor, and our results emphasize the potential role of macrophage in modulation of tumor microenvironment via secretion of OPN, PGE2 and MMP-9, which trigger angiogenesis and melanoma growth. Thus, blockade of OPN and its regulated signaling network provides unique strategy to eradicate melanoma by manipulating TAMs.},

	abstract = {Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization represents a key regulatory process of tumor progression. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) and TAMs in lung adenocarcinoma cells. THP-1 monocytes were differentiated into macrophages using PMA. PMA-treated THP-1 cells were co-cultured with human A549 cells culture supernatant. SPP1 expression in TAMs isolated from lung adenocarcinoma tissues and PMA-treated THP-1 cells were measured. Macrophage polarization was identified by flow cytometric analysis. Cell migration and apoptosis were assessed by Transwell migration assays and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. SPP1 is highly expressed in tumor tissues and TAMs isolated from patients with an advanced TNM stage, and also in PMA-treated THP-1 cells. Co-culture with A549 cells strongly induced SPP-1 expression as well as M2 polarization of THP-1 cells, but it had little effect on short hairpin SPP1 (shSPP1)-transfected THP-1 cells. Interestingly, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a critical regulator of M2 polarization, was downregulated in SPP1 knockdown THP-1 cells. Inhibition of PD-L1 induced a greater decline of the M2 markers IL-10 and Arg-1 but an increase in the M1 markers IL-12 and TNF-α. In addition, SPP1 knockdown in THP-1 cells can mitigate migration but promote apoptosis of A549 cells, and PD-L1 inhibition can further enhance this effect. THP-1 cells co-cultured with A549 cells attenuated CD4+ T-cell activation, whereas SPP1 inhibition restored T-cell activation. These results highlight the importance of SPP1 in mediating macrophage polarization and lung cancer evasion, suggesting a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer.},

Extensive research has elucidated the pivotal role of OPN in regulating the cell signaling that controls tumor progression and metastasis. This review focuses on recent advances in understanding the functional role of the OPN-induced signaling pathway in the regulation of cell migration and tumor progression and the implications for identifying novel targets for cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {Liver metastasis is a major cause of mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC). However, mechanisms underlying this process are largely unknown. Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted phosphorylated glycoprotein that is involved in tumor migration and metastasis. The role of OPN in cancer is currently unclear. In this study, OPN mRNA was examined in tissues from CRC, adjacent normal mucosa, and liver metastatic lesions using quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The protein expression of OPN and its receptors (integrin αv and CD44 v6) was detected by using an immunohistochemical (IHC) method. The role of OPN in liver metastasis was studied in established colon cancer Colo-205 and SW-480 cell lines transfected with sense- or antisense-OPN eukaryotic expression plasmids by flow cytometry and cell adhesion assay. Florescence redistribution after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study gap functional intercellular communication (GJIC) among OPN-transfected cells. It was found that OPN was highly expressed in metastatic hepatic lesions from CRC compared to primary CRC tissue and adjacent normal mucosa. The expression of OPN mRNA in tumor tissues was significantly related with the CRC stages. OPN expression was also detected in normal hepatocytes surrounding CRC metastatic lesions. Two known receptors of OPN, integrin αv and CD44v6 proteins, were strongly expressed in hepatocytes from normal liver. CRC cells with forced OPN expression exhibited increased heterotypic adhesion with endothelial cells and weakened intercellular communication. OPN plays a significant role in CRC metastasis to liver through interaction with its receptors in hepatocytes, decreased homotypic adhesion, and enhanced heterotypic adhesion.},

	abstract = {The biological significance of the almost constant presence of macrophages in the tumoral microenvironment is an issue debated by several authors. The major difficulty in understanding the role played by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in tumor progression is due to the contrasting effects of TAMs found in different studies. In addition, there is a limited information on which of the many biological activities expressed by TAMs are critical in inducing stimulatory or inhibitory effect on tumor growth. The aim of our study was: (a) to explore to what extent cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) in TAMs associated with human melanoma is expressed at different stages of tumor progression; and (b) to explore whether COX-2 expression in TAMs is stimulated by melanoma cells. In order to answer this question, we determined COX-2 positive TAMs associated with cutaneous melanocytic nevi, in situ, invasive and metastatic melanoma. In addition, we investigated whether COX-2 is expressed in peritoneal thioglycollate-elicited macrophages after co-cultivation with murine B16 melanoma cells. We found that COX-2-positive TAMs, as revealed by immunohistochemical analysis, were rare in common nevi and “dysplastic nevi”, but present in a high percentage in in situ and thin melanoma. COX-2-positive TAMs were also found in more advanced tumors and metastatic melanoma, although at a significantly lower percentage in these latter. The in vitro protocol revealed that COX-2 was expressed in peritoneal macrophages upon contact with B16 murine melanoma cells, but not with normal murine fibroblasts. On the whole, the results of in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that COX-2 expressed in TAMs appears to act as an effective biomarker of melanoma progression, and melanoma cells themselves might stimulate COX-2 in macrophages.},

	abstract = {Objective In the tumour microenvironment, critical drivers of immune escape include the oncogenic activity of the tumour cell-intrinsic osteopontin (OPN), the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and the expansion of tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs). We investigated the feasibility of targeting these pathways as a therapeutic option in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mouse models.
Design We analysed the number of tumour-infiltrating immune cells and the inflammatory immune profiles in chemically induced liver tumour isolated from wild-type and OPNknockout (KO) mice. In vitro cell cocultures were further conducted to investigate the crosstalk between TAMs and HCC cells mediated by OPN, colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1) and CSF1 receptor (CSF1R). The in vivo efficacy of anti-PD-L1 and CSF1/CSF1R inhibition was evaluated in OPN overexpressing subcutaneous or orthotopic mouse model of HCC.
Results The numbers of TAMs, as well as the expression levels of M2 macrophage markers and PD-L1 were significantly decreased, but the levels of cytokines produced by T-helper 1 (Th1) cells were upregulated in tumour tissues from OPN KO mice compared with that from the controls. In addition, we observed a positive association between the OPN and PD-L1 expression, and OPN expression and TAM infiltration in tumour tissues from patients with HCC. We further demonstrated that OPN facilitates chemotactic migration, and alternative activation of macrophages, and promotes the PD-L1 expression in HCC via activation of the CSF1-CSF1R pathway in macrophages. Combining anti-PD-L1 and CSF1R inhibition elicited potent antitumour activity and prolonged survival of OPNhigh tumour-bearing mice. Histological, flow cytometric and ELISA revealed increased CD8+ T cell infiltration, reduced TAMs and enhanced Th1/Th2 cytokine balance in multiple mouse models of HCC.
Conclusions OPN/CSF1/CSF1R axis plays a critical role in the immunosuppressive nature of the HCC microenvironment. Blocking CSF1/CSF1R prevents TAM trafficking and thereby enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the treatment of HCC.},

            Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. How to improve therapeutic options for patients with metastatic CRC is the core question for CRC treatment. However, the complexity and diversity of stromal context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in liver metastases of CRC have not been fully understood, and the influence of stromal cells on response to chemotherapy is unclear. Here we performed an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional landscape of primary CRC, matched liver metastases and blood at single-cell resolution, and a systematic examination of transcriptional changes and phenotypic alterations of the TME in response to preoperative chemotherapy (PC). Based on 111,292 single-cell transcriptomes, our study reveals that TME of treatment-naïve tumors is characterized by the higher abundance of less-activated B cells and higher heterogeneity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). By contrast, in tumors treated with PC, we found activation of B cells, lower diversity of TAMs with immature and less activated phenotype, lower abundance of both dysfunctional T cells and ECM-remodeling cancer-associated fibroblasts, and an accumulation of myofibroblasts. Our study provides a foundation for future investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying liver metastasis of CRC and its response to PC, and opens up new possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies for CRC.},

	abstract = {Simple Summary
The mortality of colorectal cancer is principally related to metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis or to the growth of initially undetectable micro-metastasis. Current therapeutic strategies are efficient in patients with locally advanced cancer, but are rarely able to cure patients with metastatic disease. Therapeutic failure is mainly associated with drug resistance and an aggressive phenotype. The identification of new biomarkers for micro-metastasis and tumor progression remains an unmet clinical need that should allow for improved patient stratification for optimal treatment and may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Osteopontin (OPN), a multifunctional protein, has emerged as a potentially valuable biomarker in several cancer types. This review principally describes the molecular mechanisms of OPN that are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and metastasis, as well as the use of OPN as a clinical biomarker. This review identifies a role for OPN as a biomarker ready for extended clinical application and discusses its use as a therapeutic target.

Abstract
A high expression of the phosphoprotein osteopontin (OPN) has been associated with cancer progression in several tumor types, including breast cancer, hepatocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer (CRC). Interestingly, OPN is overexpressed in CRC and is associated with a poor prognosis linked to invasion and metastasis. Here, we review the regulation and functions of OPN with an emphasis on CRC. We examine how epigenetic and genetic regulators interact with the key signaling pathways involved in this disease. Then, we describe the role of OPN in cancer progression, including proliferation, survival, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. Furthermore, we outline the interest of using OPN as a clinical biomarker, and discuss if and how osteopontin can be implemented as a routine assay in clinical laboratories for monitoring CRC patients. Finally, we discuss the use of OPN an attractive, but challenging, therapeutic target.},

	abstract = {Gastric cancer and liver cancer are among the most common malignancies and the leading causes of death worldwide, due to late detection and high recurrence rates. Today, these cancers have a heavy socioeconomic burden, for which a full understanding of their pathophysiological features is warranted to search for promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Osteopontin (OPN) is overexpressed in most patients with gastric and liver cancers. Over the past decade, emerging evidence has revealed a correlation of OPN level and clinicopathological features and prognosis in gastric and liver cancers, indicating its potential as an independent prognostic indicator in such patients. Functional studies have verified the potential of OPN knockdown as a therapeutic approach in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, OPN mediates multifaceted roles in the interaction between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment, in which many details need further exploration. OPN signaling results in various functions, including prevention of apoptosis, modulation of angiogenesis, malfunction of tumor-associated macrophages, degradation of extracellular matrix, activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt and nuclear factor-κB pathways, which lead to tumor formation and progression, particularly in gastric and liver cancers. This editorial aims to review recent findings on alteration in OPN expression and its clinicopathological associations with tumor progression, its potential as a therapeutic target, and putative mechanisms in gastric and liver cancers. Better understanding of the implications of OPN in tumorigenesis might facilitate development of therapeutic regimens to benefit patients with these deadly malignancies.},

Recently, the association between osteopontin (OPN) overexpression and the prognosis of CRC was investigated widely, but the results were inconsistent. Therefore, the aim of present meta-analysis was to assess the prognostic effect of osteopontin in patients with CRC. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Scopus and Chinese Medical Database were systematically searched. A total of 15 studies containing 1698 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled data of studies showed that high OPN expression was significantly associated with high tumor grades (OR = 2.24, 95\% CI 1.55–3.23), lymph node metastasis (OR = 2.36, 95\% CI 1.71–3.26) and tumor distant metastasis (OR = 2.38, 95\% CI 1.01–5.60). Moreover, high OPN expression was significantly associated with the 2-year (HR 1.97, 95\% CI 1.30–3.00), 3-year (HR 1.82, 95\% CI 1.24–2.68), 5 year (HR 1.53, 95\% CI 1.28–1.82) survival rates and overall survival (OS, HR 1.70, 95\% CI 1.12–2.60), respectively. These results indicated that OPN could serve as a prognostic biomarker and as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.},

	abstract = {A disturbance in the balance between cell proliferation and cell loss, or apoptosis, may underlie neoplastic development. Therefore, we determined spontaneous apoptotic and proliferative rates in normal, hyperplastic, adenomatous, and malignant colorectal epithelia. In paired sections, DNA strand breaks were detected using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and apoptotic cells were also identified in H\&E-stained slides by morphological criteria. Cell proliferation, bcl-2, and p53 expression were analyzed using specific monoclonal antibodies. In normal mucosa, luminal epithelial cells demonstrated higher rates of apoptosis compared to cells in the proliferative zone. Neoplastic transformation was associated with a significant increase in rates of apoptosis and proliferation. However, apoptosis, but not proliferation, decreased at the adenoma-to-carcinoma transition coincident with expression of mutant p53. In carcinomas, both mutant p53 and bcl-2 protein levels were associated with attenuated apoptotic rates. In conclusion, apoptosis is an important regulator of growth in normal and neoplastic colorectal epithelia. Increased apoptosis and proliferation accompany neoplastic transformation, suggesting that an alteration in apoptotic rates is an important event in colorectal carcinogenesis. Furthermore, the imbalance in these processes found in carcinomas may facilitate tumor growth and progression.},

Although secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1) over-expression is confirmed to associate with invasion, metastasis of CRC, the underlying mechanism by which modulates the CRC metastasis is still not fully explained.
METHOD: GDS4382 was obtained from GEO database and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed by bioinformatics methods 55 paired samples of CRC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues were collected to detect the expression of SPP1 by q-PCR and western blot. Functional analysis of siRNA-SPP1, including proliferation, apoptosis, colony formation, cell cycle, migration, was investigated in CRC cell lines and tumor xenografts were conducted in nude mice. Protein expression of E-cadherin and vimentin was detected by western blot.
RESULTS: 1887 DEGs were analyzed and selected from GDS4382, of which, SPP1 and epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) showed a close association by bioinformatics analysis. The mRNA and protein expression of SPP1 were significantly higher in CRC tissues than that in adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P{\textless}0.05). Overexpression of SPP1 closely associated with tumor invasion, metastasis and low survival in CRC. Moreover, siRNA-SPP1 repressed proliferation, cell cycle, colony formation, migration and tumor growth in vivo and promoted cell apoptosis in CRC cell lines. In addition, Protein expression of E-cadherin was obviously up-regulated and Vimentin was down-regulated in CRC cells after siRNA-SPP1 (P{\textless}0.05).
CONCLUSION: SPP1 expression was significantly up-regulated in CRC. And SPP1 promoted the metastasis of CRC by activating EMT, which could be a potentially therapeutic target for patients with CRC.},

Additionally, OPN is expressed in the presence of tumor hypoxia, which is an adverse prognostic factor in radiation oncology. One of its receptors, the proposed tumor stem cell marker CD44, is also associated with aggressive tumors, shown for example in colon cancer. The expression of CD44 and its splice variants (particularly CD44v6) can be upregulated by OPN itself. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the influence of hypoxia on the expression of OPN and its binding partners CD44 and CD44v6 in colon carcinoma cell lines in vitro, using SW480, SW620, HT29 and HCT116 cells. Additionally, we investigated the effect of irradiation on the expression pattern of OPN and its ligands, and the influence of hypoxia on the clonogenic survival of the cells after irradiation. While the expression patterns were nearly unaltered by irradiation, hypoxia led to an upregulation of OPN protein expression and an increase in the radioresistance in all tested colorectal carcinoma cell lines. However, a similar clear statement with regard to the expression of CD44 and CD44v6 is not possible. We hypothesize that the OPN receptors differ in their expression pattern between cell lines depending on the degree of their malignancy.},

	abstract = {AIM: To investigate the effects of osteopontin (OPN) gene expression knockdown on colon cancer Lovo cells in vitro., METHODS: Four candidate small interfering RNA (siRNA) constructs targeting the OPN gene and a scrambled control sequence (NC-siRNA) were synthesized and inserted into a pGPU6/GFP/Neo expression vector. After confirmation by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing, the recombinant plasmids were subsequently transfected into a human colon cancer cell line (Lovo) using a liposome transfection method. Stably transfected cells were maintained with G418 selection and referred to as Lovo-OPN-1, -2, -3, -4, and Lovo-NC cells. Knockdown efficiency of each of the four siRNA constructs was determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays and western blotting, and the construct with the most effective silencing was used for subsequent experiments. Cell proliferation, adhesion, and Matrigel invasion assays were performed to analyze the effects of OPN knockdown in stably transfected Lovo cells. The levels of four angiogenic factors, namely vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9 and urokinase plasminogen activator were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA)., RESULTS: Recombinant vectors containing OPN-specific and scrambled siRNA sequences were successfully constructed and stably transfected into Lovo cells. Compared with the control Lovo and Lovo-NC cells, the levels of OPN mRNA and protein expression in Lovo-OPN-1, -2, -3, and -4 were significantly reduced (all P {\textless} 0.05), with the most efficient reduction observed in Lovo-OPN-4 cells (P {\textless} 0.05). Relative to untransfected Lovo cells, OPN mRNA expression levels in Lovo-NC and Lovo-OPN-4 cells were 1.008 ± 0.067 and 0.160 ± 0.023, respectively. The relative OPN protein expression levels in Lovo, Lovo-NC, and Lovo-OPN-4 cells were 3.024 ± 0.211, 2.974 ± 0.630, and 0.121 ± 0.008, respectively. Moreover, transfection with the scrambled sequence had no effect on the expression of OPN. After 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of cultivation, absorption values at 450 nm to assess proliferation of Lovo-OPN-4 cells were 0.210 ± 0.017, 0.247 ± 0.024, 0.314 ± 0.037, and 0.359 ± 0.043, respectively, which were significantly lower than those of Lovo (0.244 ± 0.031, 0.313 ± 0.024, 0.513 ± 0.048 and 0.783 ± 0.051) and Lovo-NC cells (0.241 ± 0.029, 0.309 ± 0.022, 0.563 ± 0.023, and 0.735 ± 0.067) (all P {\textless} 0.05). The absorption values at 595 nm, which were measured in a cell adhesion assay, showed that adhesion of Lovo-OPN-4 cells (0.215 ± 0.036) was significantly decreased compared to Lovo (0.490 ± 0.037) and Lovo-NC cells (0.462 ± 0.043) (P {\textless} 0.05). The number of invasive Lovo-OPN-4 cells (16.1 ± 1.9) was also significantly decreased compared to Lovo (49.9 ± 5.4) and Lovo-NC cells (48.8 ± 4.5) (P {\textless} 0.05). ELISA assays showed significant reductions in Lovo-OPN-4 cells compared to Lovo and Lovo-NC cells with regard to the expression of VEGF (1687.85 ± 167.84 ng/L vs 2348.54 ± 143.80 ng/L and 2284.39 ± 138.62 ng/L, respectively), MMP-2 (2966.07 ± 177.36 μg/L vs 4084.74 ± 349.54 μg/L and 4011.41 ± 424.48 μg/L, respectively), MMP-9 (3782.89 ± 300.64 μg/L vs 5062.90 ± 303.02 μg/L and 4986.38 ± 300.75 μg/L, respectively) and uPA (1152.69 ± 120.79 μg/L vs 1380.90 ± 147.25 μg/L and 1449.80 ± 189.92 μg/L, respectively) (all P {\textless} 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Knockdown of OPN gene expression suppresses colon cancer cell growth, adherence, invasion, and expression of angiogenic factors.},

	abstract = {Cancer stem cells drive tumor formation and metastasis, but how they acquire metastatic traits is not well understood. Here, we show that all colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSCs) express CD44v6, which is required for their migration and generation of metastatic tumors. CD44v6 expression is low in primary tumors but demarcated clonogenic CR-CSC populations. Cytokines hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), osteopontin (OPN), and stromal-derived factor 1α (SDF-1), secreted from tumor associated cells, increase CD44v6 expression in CR-CSCs by activating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which promotes migration and metastasis. CD44v6(-) progenitor cells do not give rise to metastatic lesions but, when treated with cytokines, acquire CD44v6 expression and metastatic capacity. Importantly, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition selectively killed CD44v6 CR-CSCs and reduced metastatic growth. In patient cohorts, low levels of CD44v6 predict increased probability of survival. Thus, the metastatic process in colorectal cancer is initiated by CSCs through the expression of CD44v6, which is both a functional biomarker and therapeutic target.},

OPN is implicated in the progression of fibrosis, cancer, and metastatic disease in several organ systems. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), first described in embryology, is increasingly being recognized as a significant contributor to fibrotic phenotypes and tumor progression. Several well-established transcription factors regulate EMT and are conserved across tissue types and organ systems, including TWIST, zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox (ZEB), and SNAIL-family members. Recent literature points to an important relationship between OPN and EMT, implicating OPN as a key regulatory component of EMT programs. In this review, OPN’s interplay with traditional EMT activators, both directly and indirectly, will be discussed. Also, OPN’s ability to restructure the tissue and tumor microenvironment to indirectly modify EMT will be reviewed. Together, these diverse pathways demonstrate that OPN is able to modulate EMT and provide new targets for directing therapeutics.},

We examined the transcription level of OPN in 84 CRC patients and correlated the expression with their clinicopathological parameters. The associations of OPN overexpression with transcription of stem cell markers and response to chemotherapy in DLD1-OPN overexpressing clones and CRC patients were also investigated. Our results showed that OPN was significantly overexpressed in CRC, and its overexpression correlated with tumor stage and poor prognosis. Overexpression of CRC induced OCT4 and SOX2 expression in vitro and correlated with SOX2 overexpression in CRC patients. In addition, DLD1-OPN overexpressing cells showed enhanced ability to survive upon oxaliplatin treatment, and OPN expression was higher in CRC patients who were resistant to oxaliplatin-involved chemotherapy treatment. Thus, CRC cells overexpressing OPN demonstrated stem-like properties and OPN inhibition is a potential therapeutic approach to combat CRC progression and chemoresistance.},

Stage II and stage III colorectal cancer patients who had undergone R0 resection were classified into two groups: with metachronous liver metastasis (m-LM; n = 17) and without liver metastases (control; n = 24). Additionally, double-immunofluorescence staining was performed using antibodies to OPN and CD68. OPN-positive cells were frequently colocalized with CD68 immunoreactivity. OPN and microvascular density expression in the central area were significantly higher in the m-LM (OPN; control 4.3 ± 0.56, m-LV 10.8 ± 1.48, P {\textless} 0.05; microvascular density control 18.5 ± 2.86, m-LV 31.4 ± 4.39, P {\textless} 0.05), while CD68 expression in the invasive margin was significantly higher in the control group (control 98.9 ± 7.31, m-LV 28.2 ± 3.18, P {\textless} 0.05). These results suggest that the risk of metachronous liver metastasis could be well predicted by immunohistochemical staining of OPN in the central areas, and CD68 in the invasive margins of tumors.},

Osteopontin (OPN) is a secreted phosphorylated glycoprotein that is involved in tumor migration and metastasis. The role of OPN in cancer is currently unclear. In this study, OPN mRNA was examined in tissues from CRC, adjacent normal mucosa, and liver metastatic lesions using quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The protein expression of OPN and its receptors (integrin αv and CD44 v6) was detected by using an immunohistochemical (IHC) method. The role of OPN in liver metastasis was studied in established colon cancer Colo-205 and SW-480 cell lines transfected with sense- or antisense-OPN eukaryotic expression plasmids by flow cytometry and cell adhesion assay. Florescence redistribution after photobleaching (FRAP) was used to study gap functional intercellular communication (GJIC) among OPN-transfected cells. It was found that OPN was highly expressed in metastatic hepatic lesions from CRC compared to primary CRC tissue and adjacent normal mucosa. The expression of OPN mRNA in tumor tissues was significantly related with the CRC stages. OPN expression was also detected in normal hepatocytes surrounding CRC metastatic lesions. Two known receptors of OPN, integrin αv and CD44v6 proteins, were strongly expressed in hepatocytes from normal liver. CRC cells with forced OPN expression exhibited increased heterotypic adhesion with endothelial cells and weakened intercellular communication. OPN plays a significant role in CRC metastasis to liver through interaction with its receptors in hepatocytes, decreased homotypic adhesion, and enhanced heterotypic adhesion.},

	abstract = {OPN is a multifunctional phosphoglycoprotein expressed in a wide range of cells, including osteoclasts, osteoblasts, neurons, epithelial cells, T, B, NK, NK T, myeloid, and innate lymphoid cells. OPN plays an important role in diverse biological processes and is implicated in multiple diseases such as cardiovascular, diabetes, kidney, proinflammatory, fibrosis, nephrolithiasis, wound healing, and cancer. In cancer patients, overexpressed OPN is often detected in the tumor microenvironment and elevated serum OPN level is correlated with poor prognosis. Initially identified in activated T cells and termed as early T cell activation gene, OPN links innate cells to adaptive cells in immune response to infection and cancer. Recent single cell RNA sequencing revealed that OPN is primarily expressed in tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells in human cancer patients. Emerging experimental data reveal a key role of OPN is tumor immune evasion through regulating macrophage polarization, recruitment, and inhibition of T cell activation in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, in addition to its well-established direct tumor cell promotion function, OPN also acts as an immune checkpoint to negatively regulate T cell activation. The OPN protein level is highly elevated in peripheral blood of human cancer patients. OPN blockade immunotherapy with OPN neutralization monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) thus represents an attractive approach in human cancer immunotherapy.},

IRF8 bound to the Spp1 promoter to repress OPN expression in colon epithelial cells, and colon carcinoma exhibited decreased IRF8 and increased OPN expression. The elevated expression of OPN in human colon carcinoma was correlated with decreased patient survival.

	abstract = {Simple Summary
Despite the breakthrough in human cancer immunotherapy, colorectal cancer, except for the small subset of microsatellite instable colorectal cancer (MSI, {\textasciitilde}4\% total cases), is one of the few human cancers that does not respond to current immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) immunotherapy. CTLs are present in both MSI and microsatellite stable (MSS) human colon carcinoma, suggesting that PD-L1-independent mechanisms may exist and suppress CTL activation in the colon tumor microenvironment. We determined that osteopontin (OPN) inhibits tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lytic activity to promote colon tumor growth in vivo. Accordingly, OPN blockade immunotherapy using OPN neutralization monoclonal antibodies 100D3 and 103D6 suppressed colon tumor growth in vivo. Our findings indicate that 100D3 and 103D6 has the potential to be further developed for colorectal cancer immunotherapy. 

Abstract
Human colorectal cancers are mostly microsatellite-stable with no response to anti-PD-1 blockade immunotherapy, necessitating the development of a new immunotherapy. Osteopontin (OPN) is elevated in human colorectal cancer and may function as an immune checkpoint. We aimed at elucidating the mechanism of action of OPN and determining the efficacy of OPN blockade immunotherapy in suppression of colon cancer. We report here that OPN is primarily expressed in tumor cells, myeloid cells, and innate lymphoid cells in human colorectal carcinoma. Spp1 knock out mice exhibit a high incidence and fast growth rate of carcinogen-induced tumors. Knocking out Spp1 in colon tumor cells increased tumor-specific CTL cytotoxicity in vitro and resulted in decreased tumor growth in vivo. The OPN protein level is elevated in the peripheral blood of tumor-bearing mice. We developed four OPN neutralization monoclonal antibodies based on their efficacy in blocking OPN inhibition of T cell activation. OPN clones 100D3 and 103D6 increased the efficacy of tumor-specific CTLs in killing colon tumor cells in vitro and suppressed colon tumor growth in tumor-bearing mice in vivo. Our data indicate that OPN blockade immunotherapy with 100D3 and 103D6 has great potential to be further developed for colorectal cancer immunotherapy and for rendering a colorectal cancer response to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy.},

When confronted by the high dimensionality and pervasive dropout events of scRNA-Seq data, purely unsupervised clustering methods may not produce biologically interpretable clusters, which complicates cell type assignment. In such cases, the only recourse is for the user to manually and repeatedly tweak clustering parameters until acceptable clusters are found. Consequently, the path to obtaining biologically meaningful clusters can be ad hoc and laborious. Here we report a principled clustering method named scDCC, that integrates domain knowledge into the clustering step. Experiments on various scRNA-seq datasets from thousands to tens of thousands of cells show that scDCC can significantly improve clustering performance, facilitating the interpretability of clusters and downstream analyses, such as cell type assignment.},

To illustrate the insights this approach enables, we apply it to published brain organoid and visual cortex scRNA-Seq datasets; cNMF refines cell types and identifies both expected (e.g. cell cycle and hypoxia) and novel activity programs, including programs that may underlie a neurosecretory phenotype and synaptogenesis.},

The proposed method has linear stepwise computational complexity w.r.t. the number of observed variables. Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that our approach is the only method that recovers modular structure better as the dimensionality increases. We also use our approach for estimating covariance structure for a number of real-world datasets and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art estimators at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we apply the proposed method to high-resolution fMRI data (with more than 10{\textasciicircum}5 voxels) and show that it is capable of extracting meaningful patterns.},

	abstract = {With the tremendous increase of publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, bioinformatics methods based on gene co-expression network are becoming efficient tools for analyzing scRNA-seq data, improving cell type prediction accuracy and in turn facilitating biological discovery. However, the current methods are mainly based on overall co-expression correlation and overlook co-expression that exists in only a subset of cells, thus fail to discover certain rare cell types and sensitive to batch effect. Here, we developed independent component analysis-based gene co-expression network inference (ICAnet) that decomposed scRNA-seq data into a series of independent gene expression components and inferred co-expression modules, which improved cell clustering and rare cell-type discovery. ICAnet showed efficient performance for cell clustering and batch integration using scRNA-seq datasets spanning multiple cells/tissues/donors/library types. It works stably on datasets produced by different library construction strategies and with different sequencing depths and cell numbers. We demonstrated the capability of ICAnet to discover rare cell types in multiple independent scRNA-seq datasets from different sources. Importantly, the identified modules activated in acute myeloid leukemia scRNA-seq datasets have the potential to serve as new diagnostic markers. Thus, ICAnet is a competitive tool for cell clustering and biological interpretations of single-cell RNA-seq data analysis.},

To investigate neurogenic potential and cellular diversity, we profiled single-nucleus transcriptomes in five hippocampal-entorhinal subregions in humans, macaques, and pigs. Integrated cross-species analysis revealed robust transcriptomic and histologic signatures of neurogenesis in the adult mouse, pig, and macaque but not humans. Doublecortin (DCX), a widely accepted marker of newly generated granule cells, was detected in diverse human neurons, but it did not define immature neuron populations. To explore species differences in cellular diversity and implications for disease, we characterized subregion-specific, transcriptomically defined cell types and transitional changes from the three-layered archicortex to the six-layered neocortex. Notably, METTL7B defined subregion-specific excitatory neurons and astrocytes in primates, associated with endoplasmic reticulum and lipid droplet proteins, including Alzheimer’s disease-related proteins.

To investigate how the context-dependent crosstalk of different cell types enables physiological processes to proceed, we developed CellPhoneDB, a novel repository of ligands, receptors and their interactions. In contrast to other repositories, our database takes into account the subunit architecture of both ligands and receptors, representing heteromeric complexes accurately. We integrated our resource with a statistical framework that predicts enriched cellular interactions between two cell types from single-cell transcriptomics data. Here, we outline the structure and content of our repository, provide procedures for inferring cell–cell communication networks from single-cell RNA sequencing data and present a practical step-by-step guide to help implement the protocol. CellPhoneDB v.2.0 is an updated version of our resource that incorporates additional functionalities to enable users to introduce new interacting molecules and reduces the time and resources needed to interrogate large datasets. CellPhoneDB v.2.0 is publicly available, both as code and as a user-friendly web interface; it can be used by both experts and researchers with little experience in computational genomics. In our protocol, we demonstrate how to evaluate meaningful biological interactions with CellPhoneDB v.2.0 using published datasets. This protocol typically takes {\textasciitilde}2 h to complete, from installation to statistical analysis and visualization, for a dataset of {\textasciitilde}10 GB, 10,000 cells and 19 cell types, and using five threads.},

However, this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time, posing a challenge for the analysis of time-resolved phenomena such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Here we show that RNA velocity—the time derivative of the gene expression state—can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.},

Existing approaches, such as GLASSO, latent variable GLASSO, and latent tree models, suffer from high computational complexity and may impose unrealistic sparsity priors in some cases. We introduce a novel method that leverages a newly discovered connection between information-theoretic measures and structured latent factor models to derive an optimization objective which encourages modular structures where each observed variable has a single latent parent. The proposed method has linear stepwise computational complexity w.r.t. the number of observed variables. Our experiments on synthetic data demonstrate that our approach is the only method that recovers modular structure better as the dimensionality increases. We also use our approach for estimating covariance structure for a number of real-world datasets and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art estimators at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we apply the proposed method to high-resolution fMRI data (with more than 10{\textasciicircum}5 voxels) and show that it is capable of extracting meaningful patterns.},

Here, we detail the steps of a typical single-cell RNA-seq analysis, including pre-processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell- and gene-level downstream analysis. We formulate current best-practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best-practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice.

We thus define an exquisitely specific and direct enhancer-driven EWSR1-FLI1 program. In EwS tumors, cell proliferation and strong oxidative phosphorylation metabolism are associated with a well-defined range of EWSR1-FLI1 activity. In contrast, a subpopulation of cells from below and above the intermediary EWSR1-FLI1 activity is characterized by increased hypoxia.

	abstract = {With the tremendous increase of publicly available single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets, bioinformatics methods based on gene co-expression network are becoming efficient tools for analyzing scRNA-seq data, improving cell type prediction accuracy and in turn facilitating biological discovery. However, the current methods are mainly based on overall co-expression correlation and overlook co-expression that exists in only a subset of cells, thus fail to discover certain rare cell types and sensitive to batch effect. Here, we developed independent component analysis-based gene co-expression network inference (ICAnet) that decomposed scRNA-seq data into a series of independent gene expression components and inferred co-expression modules, which improved cell clustering and rare cell-type discovery. ICAnet showed efficient performance for cell clustering and batch integration using scRNA-seq datasets spanning multiple cells/tissues/donors/library types. It works stably on datasets produced by different library construction strategies and with different sequencing depths and cell numbers. We demonstrated the capability of ICAnet to discover rare cell types in multiple independent scRNA-seq datasets from different sources. Importantly, the identified modules activated in acute myeloid leukemia scRNA-seq datasets have the potential to serve as new diagnostic markers. Thus, ICAnet is a competitive tool for cell clustering and biological interpretations of single-cell RNA-seq data analysis.},

	abstract = {The mammary gland is very intricately and well organized into distinct tissues, including epithelia, endothelia, adipocytes, and stromal and immune cells. Many mammary gland diseases, such as breast cancer, arise from abnormalities in the mammary epithelium, which is mainly composed of two distinct lineages, the basal and luminal cells. Because of the limitation of traditional transcriptome analysis of bulk mammary cells, the hierarchy and heterogeneity of mammary cells within these two lineages remain unclear. To this end, using single-cell RNA-Seq coupled with FACS analysis and principal component analysis, we determined gene expression profiles of mammary epithelial cells of virgin and pregnant mice. These analyses revealed a much higher heterogeneity among the mammary cells than has been previously reported and enabled cell classification into distinct subgroups according to signature gene markers present in each group. We also identified and verified a rare CDH5+ cell subpopulation within a basal cell lineage as quiescent mammary stem cells (MaSCs). Moreover, using pseudo-temporal analysis, we reconstructed the developmental trajectory of mammary epithelia and uncovered distinct changes in gene expression and in biological functions of mammary cells along the developmental process. In conclusion, our work greatly refines the resolution of the cellular hierarchy in developing mammary tissues. The discovery of CDH5+ cells as MaSCs in these tissues may have implications for our understanding of the initiation, development, and pathogenesis of mammary tumors.},

Cells expressing the p-EMT program spatially localized to the leading edge of primary tumors. By integrating single-cell transcriptomes with bulk expression profiles for hundreds of tumors, we refined HNSCC subtypes by their malignant and stromal composition and established p-EMT as an independent predictor of nodal metastasis, grade, and adverse pathologic features.

The concept oflCA may actually be seen as an extension of the principal component analysis (PCA), which can only impose independence up to the second order and, consequently, defines directions that are orthogonal.

Here we demonstrate an algorithm for non-negative matrix factorization that is able to learn parts of faces and semantic features of text. This is in contrast to other methods, such as principal components analysis and vector quantization, that learn holistic, not parts-based, representations. Non-negative matrix factorization is distinguished from the other methods by its use of non-negativity constraints. These constraints lead to a parts-based representation because they allow only additive, not subtractive, combinations. When non-negative matrix factorization is implemented as a neural network, parts-based representations emerge by virtue of two properties: the firing rates of neurons are never negative and synaptic strengths do not change sign.},

These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of “hallmark” gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a “refined” gene set, derived from multiple “founder” sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.,},

            Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. How to improve therapeutic options for patients with metastatic CRC is the core question for CRC treatment. However, the complexity and diversity of stromal context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in liver metastases of CRC have not been fully understood, and the influence of stromal cells on response to chemotherapy is unclear. Here we performed an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional landscape of primary CRC, matched liver metastases and blood at single-cell resolution, and a systematic examination of transcriptional changes and phenotypic alterations of the TME in response to preoperative chemotherapy (PC). Based on 111,292 single-cell transcriptomes, our study reveals that TME of treatment-naïve tumors is characterized by the higher abundance of less-activated B cells and higher heterogeneity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). By contrast, in tumors treated with PC, we found activation of B cells, lower diversity of TAMs with immature and less activated phenotype, lower abundance of both dysfunctional T cells and ECM-remodeling cancer-associated fibroblasts, and an accumulation of myofibroblasts. Our study provides a foundation for future investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying liver metastasis of CRC and its response to PC, and opens up new possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies for CRC.},

We have developed a class of optimized local algorithms which are referred to as Hierarchical Alternating Least Squares (HALS) algorithms. For these purposes, we have performed sequential constrained minimization on a set of squared Euclidean distances. We then extend this approach to robust cost functions using the alpha and beta divergences and derive flexible update rules. Our algorithms are locally stable and work well for NMF-based blind source separation (BSS) not only for the over-determined case but also for an under-determined (over-complete) case (i.e., for a system which has less sensors than sources) if data are sufficiently sparse. The NMF learning rules are extended and generalized for N-th order nonnegative tensor factorization (NTF). Moreover, these algorithms can be tuned to different noise statistics by adjusting a single parameter. Extensive experimental results confirm the accuracy and computational performance of the developed algorithms, especially, with usage of multi-layer hierarchical NMF approach [3].},

            Metastasis is the primary cause of cancer-related mortality in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. How to improve therapeutic options for patients with metastatic CRC is the core question for CRC treatment. However, the complexity and diversity of stromal context of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in liver metastases of CRC have not been fully understood, and the influence of stromal cells on response to chemotherapy is unclear. Here we performed an in-depth analysis of the transcriptional landscape of primary CRC, matched liver metastases and blood at single-cell resolution, and a systematic examination of transcriptional changes and phenotypic alterations of the TME in response to preoperative chemotherapy (PC). Based on 111,292 single-cell transcriptomes, our study reveals that TME of treatment-naïve tumors is characterized by the higher abundance of less-activated B cells and higher heterogeneity of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). By contrast, in tumors treated with PC, we found activation of B cells, lower diversity of TAMs with immature and less activated phenotype, lower abundance of both dysfunctional T cells and ECM-remodeling cancer-associated fibroblasts, and an accumulation of myofibroblasts. Our study provides a foundation for future investigation of the cellular mechanisms underlying liver metastasis of CRC and its response to PC, and opens up new possibilities for the development of therapeutic strategies for CRC.},

We identified significant and divergent transcriptional responses to stimulation in each of the 30 cell types characterized, thus revealing 611 stimulus-responsive genes. Excitatory pyramidal neurons exhibited inter- and intralaminar heterogeneity in the induction of stimulus-responsive genes. Non-neuronal cells showed clear transcriptional responses that may regulate experience-dependent changes in neurovascular coupling and myelination. Together, these results reveal the dynamic landscape of the stimulus-dependent transcriptional changes occurring across cell types in the visual cortex; these changes are probably critical for cortical function and may be sites of deregulation in developmental brain disorders.},

In addition to VEGF receptor tyrosine kinases, the neuropilins (NRPs) are critical for mediating the effects of VEGF on CSCs, primarily because of their ability to impact the function of growth factor receptors and integrins. VEGF/NRP signaling can regulate the expression and function of key molecules that have been implicated in CSC function including Rho family guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and transcription factors. The VEGF/NRP signaling axis is a prime target for therapy because it can confer resistance to standard chemotherapy, which is ineffective against most CSCs.

Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. Though immune checkpoint inhibition has proven effective for a number of other tumors, it offers benefits in only a small group of CRC. In general, heterogenous cell groups in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are considered as the major barrier for unveiling the causes of low immune response. Therefore, deconvolution of cellular components in highly heterogeneous microenvironments is crucial for understanding those mechanisms. Single cell sequencing technology revolutionized TME research enabling profiling cells in high resolution. Methods: We have analyzed scRNA-seq data from 23 CRC patients with pre-treatment primary tumors using Seurat V3 pipeline. To investigate intercellular ligand-receptor interactions, we used CellPhoneDB and CellChat methods. The results of two independent analyses showed 4 CRC samples with no SPP1-CD44 interaction. It is known, that OPN which is the protein encoded by SPP1 gene, binds to CD44 and can cause cell survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Interestingly, analysis of the cellular composition of all 23 samples did not reveal differences in SPP1+ macrophages’ content for those 4 “no SPP1-CD44” samples. To investigate the mechanisms that could cause differences in SPP1-CD44 expression across the samples, we analyzed developmental trajectories of single cells using Slingshot trajectory inference method. Results: Ligand-receptor interactions analysis revealed 4 CRC samples that lacked SPP1-CD44 interaction that is known to be responsible for tumor progression in CRC. But the proportion of SPP1+ cells was not significantly different in those 4 samples compared to other samples. Trajectory inference analysis showed that the cells from “no SPP1-CD44” samples had high expression of anti-inflammatory macrophage markers in the end of the trajectory. While cells from “high SPP1-CD44” samples had high expression of pro-inflammatory macrophage markers at the same point. Conclusions: Based on our data-driven study, we suggest that SPP1+ macrophages’ heterogeneity may affect SPP1-CD44 interaction. Thus, targeting SPP1+ macrophages that have anti-inflammatory phenotype can potentially interrupt SPP1-CD44 interaction and therefore reduce tumor progression and immune suppression.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are liquid biopsies that represent micrometastatic disease and may offer unique insights into future recurrences in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Due to CTC rarity and limited stability, no stable CTC-derived xenograft (CDX) models have ever been generated from non-metastatic NSCLC patients directly. Alternative strategies are needed to molecularly characterize CTCs and means of potential future metastases in this potentially curable patient group.
METHODS: Surgically resected NSCLC primary tumor tissues from non-metastatic patients were implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice to establish primary tumor patient-derived xenograft (ptPDX) models. CTCs were isolated as liquid biopsies from the blood of ptPDX mice and re-implanted subcutaneously into naïve immunodeficient mice to generate liquid biopsy CTC-derived xenograft (CDX) tumor models. Single cell RNA sequencing was performed and validated in an external dataset of non-xenografted human NSCLC primary tumor and metastases tissues. Drug response testing in CDX models was performed with standard of care chemotherapy (carboplatin/paclitaxel). Blockade of MYC, which has a known role in drug resistance, was performed with a MYC/MAX dimerization inhibitor (10058-F4).
RESULTS: Out of ten ptPDX, two (20\%) stable liquid biopsy CDX mouse models were generated. Single cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed an additional regenerative alveolar epithelial type II (AT2)-like cell population in CDX tumors that was also identified in non-xenografted NSCLC patients' metastases tissues. Drug testing using these CDX models revealed different treatment responses to carboplatin/paclitaxel. MYC target genes and c-MYC protein were upregulated in the chemoresistant CDX model, while MYC/MAX dimerization blocking could overcome chemoresistance to carboplatin/paclitaxel.
CONCLUSIONS: To overcome the lack of liquid biopsy CDX models from non-metastatic NSCLC patients, CDX models can be generated with CTCs from ptPDX models that were originally established from patients' primary tumors. Single cell analyses can identify distinct drug responses and cell heterogeneities in CDX tumors that can be validated in NSCLC metastases tissues. CDX models deserve further development and study to discover personalized strategies against micrometastases in non-metastatic NSCLC patients.},

	abstract = {Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) infiltration is associated with survival, recurrence, and therapeutic response in colorectal cancer (CRC). Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, which requires CTLs for response, does not work for most CRC patients. Therefore, it is critical to improve our understanding of immune resistance in this disease. We utilized 2391 CRC patients and 7 omics datasets, integrating clinical and genomic data to determine how DNA methylation may impact survival and CTL function in CRC. Using comprehensive molecular subtype (CMS) 1 patients as reference, we found TBX21 to be the only gene with altered expression and methylation that was associated with CTL infiltration. We found that CMS1 patients with high TBX21 expression and low methylation had a significant survival advantage. To confirm the role of Tbx21 in CTL function, we utilized scRNAseq data, demonstrating the association of TBX21 with markers of enhanced CTL function. Further analysis using pathway enrichment found that the genes TBX21, MX1, and SP140 had altered expression and methylation, suggesting that the TP53/P53 pathway may modify TBX21 methylation to upregulate TBX21 expression. Together, this suggests that targeting epigenetic modification more specifically for therapy and patient stratification may provide improved outcomes in CRC.},

	doi = {10.1109/BIBM52615.2021.9669391},
	abstract = {Many high-quality biological pathways are presented in figures and text in biomedical literature. They are great resources for studies of biological mechanisms and precision medicine practices. These pathways need to be carefully curated, reconciled, and transformed into a computable form. Current manual curation approaches are inadequate in keeping up with the pace of the literature growth. New bio-curation approaches are needed to streamline the identification of gene interactions from pathway figures and text. This paper proposes a pathway curation approach for identifying genes and their interactions using both figures and text of biomedical articles. Our method integrates deep learning-based object detection models with a Google optical character recognition service to extract genes and their interactions from pathway figures. Our pipeline was evaluated on the figures from PubMed publications with manual annotations. The results demonstrated that our model could effectively retrieve genes and their interactions in pathway figures. The proposed pipeline may accelerate various applications of the latest biomedical discoveries. We also developed a web server at http://pathwaydeep.top to provide the gene interaction curation on uploaded pathway figures and corresponding articles.},

	doi = {10.4103/jpi.jpi_30_19},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Free-text sections of pathology reports contain the most important information from a diagnostic standpoint. However, this information is largely underutilized for computer-based analytics. The vast majority of NLP-based methods lack a capacity to accurately extract complex diagnostic entities and relationships among them as well as to provide an adequate knowledge representation for downstream data-mining applications.
METHODS: In this paper, we introduce a novel informatics pipeline that extends open information extraction (openIE) techniques with artificial intelligence (AI) based modeling to extract and transform complex diagnostic entities and relationships among them into Knowledge Graphs (KGs) of relational triples (RTs).
RESULTS: Evaluation studies have demonstrated that the pipeline's output significantly differs from a random process. The semantic similarity with original reports is high (Mean Weighted Overlap of 0.83). The precision and recall of extracted RTs based on experts' assessment were 0.925 and 0.841 respectively (P {\textless}0.0001). Inter-rater agreement was significant at 93.6\% and inter-rated reliability was 81.8\%.
CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated important properties of the pipeline such as high accuracy, minimality and adequate knowledge representation. Therefore, we conclude that the pipeline can be used in various downstream data-mining applications to assist diagnostic medicine.},
