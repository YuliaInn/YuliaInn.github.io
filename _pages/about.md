I am a fifth-year PhD student in bioinformatics at University of Missouri, Columbia. Ð¬y primary focus lies in developing efficient pipelines for interpreting single-cell RNA-seq data. This area holds immense significance in bioinformatics, as it allows us to delve into the intricacies of individual cells at a molecular level. By improving these pipelines, I aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of data analysis, unlocking deeper insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene expression patterns.

In my pursuit of making meaningful contributions to cancer research, I apply my expertise in machine learning to address the intricate task of tumor microenvironment deconvolution. This area is crucial in understanding the complexities of cancer biology, as the tumor microenvironment plays a pivotal role in disease progression. By employing machine learning techniques, I aspire to shed light on the diverse cell types and components within the tumor microenvironment, potentially revealing novel avenues for therapeutic interventions.

Beyond my academic endeavors, I am an active member of the Association of Women in Sciences (AWIS) St. Louis chapter, where I strive to promote diversity and empower women in STEM fields. Additionally, I take great pride in serving as the Vice President of Alternative Career Exploration in the Sciences (ACES), a student organization dedicated to helping graduate students explore career paths beyond academia. Through ACES, I organize events and invite industry experts to campus, fostering an environment where fellow students can discover diverse career opportunities and thrive in various professional settings.

In summary, I am driven by a passion for bioinformatics and its potential to revolutionize healthcare and cancer research. I am committed to pushing the boundaries of knowledge and making a positive impact in the scientific community. With each step I take in my academic journey, I am determined to contribute to advancements in the field and prepare future scientists for successful careers in a rapidly evolving world.
